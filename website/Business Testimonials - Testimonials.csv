Instead of typing an IFSC code and a 16-digit bank number, customers now have to make a ₹ 1 UPI payment—which is very intuitive for them. And in the response, we get data that cannot be spoofed. For us, it’s a good fraud mitigant. For a customer, it’s a good experience. Our onboarding drop-offs at the bank account stage have dropped from 18-20% to less than 4% now! A huge leap from what we experienced with regular Penny Drop"
