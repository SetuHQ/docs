When instantiated, this object contains <ol><li>the amount that has to be settled,</li><li>The payment destination destination details</li><li>When the settlement should happen, and</li><li>A transaction reference ID</li></ol>. During a transaction, the BPP reserves the right to decide the terms of payment. However, the BAP can send its terms to the BPP first. If the BPP does not agree to those terms, it must overwrite the terms and return them to the BAP. If overridden, the BAP must either agree to the terms sent by the BPP in order to preserve the provider's autonomy, or abort the transaction. In case of such disagreements, the BAP and the BPP can perform offline negotiations on the payment terms. Once an agreement is reached, the BAP and BPP can resume transactions.

        XInput:
            description: Contains any additional or extended inputs required to confirm an order. This is typically a Form Input. Sometimes, selection of catalog elements is not enough for the BPP to confirm an order. For example, to confirm a flight ticket, the airline requires details of the passengers along with information on baggage, identity, in addition to the class of ticket. Similarly, a logistics company may require details on the nature of shipment in order to confirm the shipping. A recruiting firm may require additional details on the applicant in order to confirm a job application. For all such purposes, the BPP can choose to send this object attached to any object in the catalog that is required to be sent while placing the order. This object can typically be sent at an item level or at the order level. The item level XInput will override the Order level XInput as it indicates a special requirement of information for that particular item. Hence the BAP must render a separate form for the Item and another form at the Order level before confirmation.
