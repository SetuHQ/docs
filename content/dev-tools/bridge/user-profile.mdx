## User profile

Your user profile contains your account details, like e-mail, phone number (optional) and access details to one or more Bridge accounts.

### How can you access user profile?
You can check all the details attached to your personal profile.

1. **Edit personal details:** You can update your phone number, but the verified email ID provided initially cannot be changed.
2. **Organisation listing:** View the list of organisations where you are invited.
3. **Security preferences:** Enable or disable two-factor authentication (2FA) and change your password.

### When do I have access to multiple organisations, and how do I access it?

You can have access to multiple Bridge parent org accounts, if you’re invited as a user to them or manage them as an aggregator. You can either have an Admin or a Reporter role for these accounts, and access either all sub-org accounts or a subset of them. 

To switch between organisations you are part of, follow these steps:

1. **Click on your name:** Open the dropdown menu.
2. **Check the list of organisations:** The currently active organisation is marked with a green tick. You can view the list of all other organisations.
3. **Select or search for another organisation:** Click on the organisation you want to switch to. In case you have access to more than 3 accounts, a search bar will be visible and you can search by typing in the name (at least 3 characters) or ID of the Bridge account. You can click the organisation and that account’s details will appear in Bridge.
