## The Bridge

The Bridge is a single web portal that lets you pick, configure and go live with your Setu integrations, generate and download transaction and settlement reports, invite users from your organisation to use our platform—with more features on the way.

This is intended to be an entirely a self-serve console, with all your information related to your Setu integration available in just a few clicks. Of course, some workflows are still dependent on offline methods, but we are working hard to provide a seamless, fully-online experience for all of our financial integrations.

### Basic terminology

Here are some terms you might see repeated through out these guides—

##### Partner

Any business entity that integrates with Setu to use our platform is called a “partner”. Once sign-up on the Bridge is complete, the entity is given a `partnerID`, that uniquely identifies them on our system, and can now begin using our offerings.

##### Product

Setu offers multiple financial API integrations, each of them solving for a particular use case. The Collect BBPS product lets you get listed as a biller on the Bharat Bill Payment System, while the FD product lets you embed a full-fledged fixed deposit flow into your app. Each of these discrete, individual offerings is called a “product”.

##### Product configuration / Configured product

These aforementioned products, each need a set of input parameters before you can start using them for your needs. The products come as an empty template, where you can enter the required details before you can test them and go live.

For example, the Collect BBPS product requires the partner to enter details about where to fetch bills from, how to identify customers on their system, and where to settle the incoming payments. These together, make up the “configuration” required for the Collect BBPS to begin making transactions.

Once the configuration has been set, the partner now has a “configured product”, which they can now begin testing. Partners can create as many product configurations as they need, there are no limits.

##### Sandbox / production environments

Once a partner is on-boarded, they are given access to a virtual isolated space inside which they can configure and test as many products and configurations as they wish. This is called the “sandbox” environment. Transactions made in sandbox are all mocked, meaning there is no actual movement of money between the involved parties.

Once the partner is satisfied with testing in sandbox, they can now submit their product configuration to Setu for a final round of review, along with the org KYC. Once we verify the configuration and the KYC, the partner is now given access to the “production”, or “prod” environment.

Here, in the production environment, partners can create as many fresh configurations as required, which can be be taken “live”. Transactions made with these configurations would trigger actual movement of money between the parties.

Data is not shared between sandbox and production—so configurations exist independently on sandbox and production. You can switch between them easily by hovering over the coloured border on the top of each page. Sandbox is coloured orange, and production is coloured green.
