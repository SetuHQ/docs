## API keys

On-boarded partners can make API requests to Setu’s systems. Partner admins can create and manage API keys on the Bridge to authenticate such requests.

Setu currently supports two types of authentication—

- OAuth keys, which allows for one-to-many and many-to-one relationships between keys and product configurations. OAuth also has support for enabling/disabling keys, regenerating and deleting keys as needed.
- JWT keys, where each product configuration has an unique key pair that is visible on the Bridge. JWT does not support any of the advanced functionality that OAuth offers.
