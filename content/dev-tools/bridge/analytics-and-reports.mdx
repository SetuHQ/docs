## Analytics and reports

### Overview

Analytics and reports are separate per product, since they function differently. For payments products like UPI, or BBPS, you get details related to customer payments; while for data products like Account Aggregator or our KYC suite, you can view all data requests and success rates.

**Analytics for live products are made available on the home page, and provide an overview of your integration’s performance.** You can dive into detailed analytics and reports for more information on each transaction or data request, their statuses, and other relevant details.

**Reports, with all columns included, can also be downloaded in CSV or Excel formats for a specified time range.** If the count of rows in the table is too large, you will get an option to mail it to yourself.

### Are combined analytics and reports available for my products?
Yes, the Bridge aggregates data across product instances and child accounts, but only within each product category.

For example, let’s say your company is ABC Pvt. Ltd. You have multiple child sub-orgs with Setu, as described below:
1. **One Account Aggregator sub-org** for an FIU integration. 
2. **Two BBPS BOU sub-orgs** for different BBPS BOU biller integrations. Let’s say your company offers different products to customer via two subsidiaries—ABC Loans for lending and ABC Mutual Funds for distributing ETFs. Since these are two separate entities, Setu needs to do KYC verification and on-boarding for each entity, to let you collect payments for these use cases via BBPS.

In this case, analytics and reports are separate for the Account Aggregator and BBPS BOU product categories. But for BBPS BOU, data is combined across both child accounts by default, and you can filter reports by product instance ID on the UI to view them separately.

### Who can access the reports?
Admin or reporter roles can both access product data. However, you can choose to limit access when you have multiple child sub-orgs—you can extend access to data across multiple child accounts, or only a subset of child accounts.

You can control access for users by going to **Settings > User management.** Select the child account  to add a new user or edit access for an existing one. Please note, you can view and edit user details only if you are an admin for the parent Bridge account, or at least one of its child accounts that you want to control access to.

##### Account Aggregator
The <a href="https://docs.setu.co/data/account-aggregator/api-integration">account aggregator API</a> consists of two components: consent request and data fetch. Analytics reports provide insights into the performance of both APIs. Each analytics and report can be filtered by time period or product instance.

            The consent request API enables the generation of consent requests, which can subsequently be approved, rejected, or left pending. Analytics provide insights into the total number of consent requests generated and their statuses, such as approved, pending, or rejected.
            <br /><br />
            From consent generation to approval, several steps are involved, including consent generation, opening of the approval interface, user login, account verification, and final approval. Analytics offer insights into each of these steps through a funnel visualisation.<br /><br />
            Consent request generation and conversion trends can be monitored for specific time periods. Additionally, if any consent remains pending or gets rejected, the system displays the reason for it. <br />

            These reports can be emailed or downloaded in CSV or XLSX format. Invoices for any particular month can also be downloaded from the reports section.<br /><br />
            Various filters are available, including product instance, time range, consent status, consent ID, FIP, mobile number, fetch type, and purpose code.

            Data fetch creation and delivery trends can be viewed for specific time periods. Analytics also provide insights into data fetch failures by financial information provider (FIP).

Aadhaar analytics tracks how well the API performs across these stages. You’ll see key numbers like the total verification requests created, the percentage of successful data fetches, and the average time to complete a request. Failed and expired requests are tracked too. A funnel view shows how requests flow through the API stages, and a pie chart breaks down failure reasons. Analytics can be filtered by timeframe.
