## Failure Notifications

#### Outgoing event alerts sent by Setu to partners.

Currently, there is only one event `BILL_SETTLEMENT_STATUS`, which triggers a failure notification.

<hr class="primary" />

### Bill fulfilment status

After Setu receives a callback from the bank for a particular payment, we send a `PAYMENT_SUCCESSFUL` or `PAYMENT_FAILED` notification to the merchant.

<br />

#### Payment failed notification

A payment can fail for multiple reasons as explained below:

| **Status Code** | **Reason**                                               | **Description**                                                | **Next Steps for Merchants**                                  |
