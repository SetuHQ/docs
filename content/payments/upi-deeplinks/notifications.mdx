## Notifications

#### Outgoing event alerts sent by Setu to partners.

Currently, there are two types of events — `BILL_FULFILMENT_STATUS` and `BILL_SETTLEMENT_STATUS`, which triggers a notification for the following events.

<hr class="primary" />

### Bill fulfilment status

After Setu receives a callback from the bank for a particular payment, we send a `PAYMENT_SUCCESSFUL` or `PAYMENT_FAILED`  or  `PAYMENT_ATTEMPT_FAILED` notification to the merchant.

#### Payment failed notification

A payment can fail for multiple reasons as explained below:

| Reason                     | When does this happen?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Amount validation failed` | If the payment amount does not satisfy the `amountExactness` condition specified during payment link creation.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `Payment link has expired` | If the payment was made after the `expiryDate` set during payment link creation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `Missed credit alert`      | In rare scenarios, the bank system does not send us a credit alert in real time. But when we process all transactions in the following settlement cycle, and if `delayed processing` configuration is disabled for the merchant, the bill is marked as `PAYMENT_FAILED` and notification is sent. |
| `Payment address inactive` | When a customer makes multiple payments using the same payment link, only the first one is honoured. For all others, a failure notification is sent.                                                                                                                                              |
| `TPV check failed`         | If TPV check by Setu is enabled and account validation fails.

#### Payment attempt failed notification

Merchants receive notifications if a payment attempt fails due to incorrect UPI MPIN, insufficient balance, network errors, or other reasons. The bill created won’t expire, allowing customers to retry the payment.

### Bill settlement status

<br />

#### Bill settled notification

A `SETTLEMENT_SUCCESSFUL` notification is sent to the merchant after successful payments from Setu to the merchant. This depends on the settlement frequency agreed upon between Setu and the merchant.

<CodeBlockWithCopy language="json">
    {`{
     "partnerDetails": {
        "appID": "string",  // your unique app ID in Setu system, this is constant
        "productInstanceID": "string"  // your unique product instance ID in Setu system, this is constant
    },
    "events": [
        {
            "data": {
                "amountSettled": {  
                    // amount settled by Setu, in paisa
                    "currencyCode": "INR",
                    "value": 1084
                },
                "platformBillIds": [  
                    // list of platform bill IDs that are processed in this settlement
                    405884202257482938,

### Refund status

<br />

#### Refund initiated notification

Refunds are initiated in batch, along with settlements. A batch notification is sent for all processed refunds, once our partner bank initiates refund of the amount, which can be determined by `"type" : "REFUND_STATUS"`.

The refunds array in the notification provides the details of all transactions for which refund is initiated.

#### Refund successful notification

Setu does not have a refund successful notification yet, since this information is not available over APIs.

<hr class="secondary" />

As next steps, you can start your internal reconciliation process or consume our <a href="/payments/upi-deeplinks/reports" target="_blank">Report APIs ↗</a> to get detailed settlement reports.
