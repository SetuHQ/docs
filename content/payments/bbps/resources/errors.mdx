## Error codes

Typical errors you might come across, and what to do in the face of adversity.

### Sample error object

<CodeBlockWithCopy language="json">
  {`// Sample error object
{
    "status"  : number, // HTTP status code, (eg 400, 404 etc)
    "success" : false,
    "error"   : {
        "code"    : "string",  // Setu error code
        "title"   : "string",  // Title of the error
        "detail"  : "string",  // Detail of the error
        "docURL"  : "string",  // optional — if there is any documentation about the error
        "traceID" : "string",  // optional — trace
 
        //  The child error array follows a similar pattern as above
        "errors" : [
            "code"    : "string",
            "title"   : "string",
            "detail"  : "string",
            "docURL"  : "string",
        ]
    }
}`}

#### Payment processor errors

These error codes are specific to the payment processor.

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>400</th>
      <td>incorrect-charge</td>
      <td>
        One or more of the charge calculations don’t seem to add up. This could
        either mean that the MDR doesn’t match the payment instrument and
        scheme, or a simple math error. Investigate further to determine the
        cause.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>400</th>
      <td>incorrect-amount</td>
      <td>
        The requested amount for this bill seems wrong. This could mean that the
        aggregate refund amount does not match the payment or refund transaction
        amounts. In some cases, it might be that the processing fee amount
        doesn’t match the charge component amounts.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>400</th>
      <td>incorrect-transaction-count</td>
      <td>
        The total number of transactions mentioned seems wrong. There are three
        possibilities for this mismatch—payment transaction count and its
        aggregate, the refund transaction count and its aggregate, or the total
        transaction count and its aggregate. Dig deeper to determine the exact
        cause.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>400</th>
      <td>settlement-failed</td>
      <td>The bill settlement request has failed.</td>
