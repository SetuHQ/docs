## Fetch & Pay

<hr class="tertiary" />

### APIs to implement

##### Fetch customer bill

This is a multi-leg transaction between BBPS, Setu, and the biller system.

BBPS calls Setu with customer identifier(s) details entered by a customer on a BBPS enabled app / offline collection point.

Setu calls the biller with the same details with the API to <a href="/payments/bbps/api-reference#/category~APIs_to_call/operation~fetchBills" target="_blank"><code>fetch bill</code> ↗</a> for the customer, and then, shares it with BBPS.

    alt="BBPS bill fetch cycle"
/>

The biller’s API URL is expected to be in the following format—

<CodeBlockWithCopy language="bash">
    {`https://<partner-base-api-url>/bills/fetch`}
</CodeBlockWithCopy>

<br />

<Callout type="tip">
    Please note, Setu will add the <code>/bills/fetch</code> at the end of this
    URL.
</Callout>

<br />

The request body will specify the customer identifier—

<CodeBlockWithCopy language="json">
    {`{
      "customerIdentifiers": [
        {
          "attributeName": "customerId",
          "attributeValue": "9117534711"
        }
      ]
}`}
</CodeBlockWithCopy>

<br />

**Note:**

-   `customerId` is defined as per biller's use case, such as loanNumber, studentId, etc

###### Response scenarios

When BBPS sends a fetch bill request to Setu, Setu forwards the request to biller specified `baseURL`. Setu expects to receive a response from the biller system, with three possible scenarios—

-   Success, with outstanding bill for customer
-   Identifier matched, but no outstanding bill for customer
-   Failure, no customer found

<hr class="tertiary" />

**Scenario 1: Success, with outstanding bill for customer**

The is when the customer is present in the biller system, and has outstanding bills. In this case, the biller can return a `200` response—

<CodeBlockWithCopy language="json">
    {`{
  "data": {
    "customer": {
      "name": "Sharmaji Ka Beta",
      "additionalInfo": [
        {
          "EMI Amount": "900"
        },
        {
          "Charges": "100"
        }
      ]
    },
    "billDetails": {
      "bills": [
        {
          "items": [],
          "generatedOn": "2022-06-07T05:18:02.234Z",
          "customerAccount": {
            "id": "9117534711"
          },
          "recurrence": "ONE_TIME",
          "aggregates": {
            "total": {
              "amount": {
                "value": 100000, // in paise
                "currencyCode": "INR"
              },
              "displayName": "Total Receivable"
            }
          },
          "billerBillID": "891234567",
          "amountExactness": "EXACT"
        }
      ],
      "billFetchStatus": "AVAILABLE"
    }
  },
  "status": 200,
  "success": true
}`}
</CodeBlockWithCopy>

<br />

**Note**

-   `additionalInfo` items will be displayed in the Payment App/site which can describe additional information about the bill.
-   `items` are used to show details about the bill / itemized break up. Maximum of 4.
-   `generatedOn` and `dueDate` must adhere to the following guidelines from NPCI
    -   `generatedOn` should not be greater than `dueDate`
    -   `generatedOn` should not be a future date
    -   `dueDate` should not be equal to `generatedOn`

<hr class="tertiary" />

**Scenario 2: Identifier matched, but no outstanding bill for customer**

When a customer is identified in the biller system but has paid all bills, and so, has no outstanding bill amount. In this case, the biller can return a `200` response—

<CodeBlockWithCopy language="json">
    {`{
      "data": {
        "billDetails": {
          "billFetchStatus": "NO_OUTSTANDING",
          "bills": []
        },
        "customer": {
          "name": "Sharmaji Ka Beta"
        }
      },
      "success": true,
      "status": 200
}`}
</CodeBlockWithCopy>

<br />

The `dueDate` can be the last payment date from the customer or the current timestamp.

<hr class="tertiary" />

**Scenario 3: Failure, no customer found**

Either the biller does not recognise the parameter, or there are no customers with that particular parameter.
Then, the biller can return a `400` response—

<CodeBlockWithCopy language="json">
    {`{
      "success": false,
      "status": 400,
      "error": {
        "traceID": "XXXXXX",
        "code": "customer-not-found",
        "docURL": "",
        "detail": "A customer with the provided credentials does not exist in the biller system.",
        "title": "customer-not-found"
      }
}`}
</CodeBlockWithCopy>

<br />

<hr class="secondary" />

##### Fetch bill payment receipt

This is a multi-leg transaction between BBPS, Setu, and the biller system. As described in the diagram below, BBPS calls Setu, and Setu in turn calls the biller with <a href="/payments/bbps/api-reference#/category~APIs_to_Implement/operation~fetchBillReceipt" target="_blank"><code>fetchBillReceipt</code> ↗</a>

<MainImage
    src="https://storage.googleapis.com/strapi-assets/latest/BBPS_Payment_cycle_2x_3d58b5d3d3/BBPS_Payment_cycle_2x_3d58b5d3d3.png"
    alt="BBPS payment cycle"
/>

Once a payment is received against a bill, Setu gets a notification and in turn makes the <a href="/payments/bbps/api-reference#/category~APIs_to_Implement/operation~fetchBillReceipt" target="_blank"><code>fetchBillReceipt</code> ↗</a> API call to the biller system. The biller’s API URL should be in the following format—

<CodeBlockWithCopy language="json">
    {`https://<partner-base-api-url>/bills/fetchReceipt`}
</CodeBlockWithCopy>

<br />

<Callout type="tip">
    Setu adds the <code>/bills/fetchReceipt</code> at the end of biller provided{" "}
    <code>baseURL</code>.{" "}
</Callout>

<br />

A typical request for a receipt would look something like—

<CodeBlockWithCopy language="json">
    {`{
      "platformBillID": "906910589572351478",
      "billerBillID": "891234567",
      "paymentDetails": {
        "amountPaid": {
          "value": 1000,
          "currencyCode": ""
        },
        "billAmount": {
          "value": 1000,
          "currencyCode": ""
        },
        "platformTransactionRefID": "26602931-3b6a-4c87-a14d-5d7cf584008f",
        "uniquePaymentRefID": "PP012151MYB616O9BSY1",
        "instrument": "UPI",
        "additionalInfo": null,
        "transactionNote": "",
        "transactionTimestamp": "2020-05-22T03:05:22.000Z",
        "campaignID": ""
      }
}`}
</CodeBlockWithCopy>

<br />

Once you receive this call—

1. Create a receipt against `uniquePaymentRefID`.
2. Update your ledger to reflect this new balance.
3. Return a `200` response with `id` and `date`.

###### Success response

<CodeBlockWithCopy language="json">
    {`{
      "status": 200,
      "success": true,
      "data": {
        "receipt": {
          "id": "XYZ987-891234567",
          "date": "2022-06-07T05:55:54.789Z"
        }
      }
}`}
</CodeBlockWithCopy>

<hr class="tertiary" />

###### Failure scenarios

**Case 1**

If your system cannot accept or process payment due to some use case or validation related error or business requirement or Technical error on biller server (such as server down, bad gateway, unavailable, etc), you respond with a `500` response -

<CodeBlockWithCopy language="json">
    {`{
    "status": 500,
    "success": false,
    "error": {
        "code": "unable-to-fulfill-request",
        "detail": "An error occured while processing this request.",
        "docURL": "",
        "title": "API_ERROR",
        "errors": [],
        "traceID": "XXXXXX"
    }
}`}
</CodeBlockWithCopy>

<hr class="tertiary" />

**Note:**

-   During Payment request, when your system fails to respond to Setu in 30 secs or responds with an error, the request to `/fetchReceipt`
    will be reattempted with the same request body as the first attempt.
-   You must implement a Duplicate check against `uniquePaymentRefID`
    -   If the `uniquePaymentRefID` doesn't exist for that Transaction, you must update the same and return a `200` Success response
    -   If the same `uniquePaymentRefID` exists in your system for that Transaction, you can return a `200` Success response

<hr class="secondary" />

##### Security considerations

1. The API should work from only whitelisted IPs (on production)
2. HTTPS is mandatory
3. Authentication mechanism is required. Supported
   methods—Basic auth, JWT, OAuth.

<hr class="primary" />

#### APIs to call

##### Expire Bill (optional)

This API immediately changes the status of an unpaid link to `BILL_EXPIRED`. The customer would not be able to pay using the link or the associated VPA, but even if they are somehow able to do that (due to app caching or similar issues) the amount would automatically be refunded.

`platformBillID` is a unique identifier for a bill on Setu's system and has to be provided to expire the bill. This is made available in the Create Payment Link API's response.

                <code>Authorization</code>: Bearer (<b>insert_token_here</b>). Read
                about how to generate this token <a

                >
                    here
                </a>.
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

###### Success

<CodeBlockWithCopy language="json">
    {`{
    "status"  : 200,
    "success" : true
}`}
</CodeBlockWithCopy>

###### Failure

In case the `platformBillID` provided is incorrect, Setu will respond with `400` bill not found error—

<CodeBlockWithCopy language="json">
    {`{
    "status": 400,
    "success": false,
    "error": {
        "code": "bill-not-found",
        "detail": "Bill with ID [<platformBillID>] not found.",
        "docURL": "",
        "title": "PLATFORM_ERROR",
        "errors": [],
        "traceID": "XXXXXX"
    }
}`}
</CodeBlockWithCopy>

If a bill has been expired, ideally, a payment by a customer would not be allowed, if verify VPA call returns an error on a payment app.

But if the verify VPA call was not made and the customer makes a payment, payment will go through but will be refunded in the settlement flow.
