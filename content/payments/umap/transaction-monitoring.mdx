## Transaction monitoring

### Transaction statuses

The UPI Setu platform ensures transparency throughout the transaction cycle, by defining clear statuses that a transaction can have from initiation to completion. These statuses reflect the transaction's current state, based on the responses received from various entities involved. Understanding these statuses helps merchants manage transactions effectively.

`payment_initiated`&nbsp;Payment has been attempted by a customer.

`payment_ending`&nbsp;Payment is currently being processed by UPI Setu.

`payment_successful`&nbsp;Payment has been successfully completed.

`payment_failed`&nbsp;Payment could not be processed.
