## Payment notification

<<<<<<< HEAD
Any UPI Setu product relies on creating and presenting payment request to a customer. Setu’s UPI Setu stack provides consistent and transparent payment statuses for a merchant, to be able to track the life-cycle of a payment request. These statuses are shown in the diagram below.

=======
Most of the products on our platform end up creating a payment event when a customer interacts with it from a Payer PSP. We provide consistent and transparent payment statuses for a merchant, to be able to track the life-cycle of a payment request. These statuses are shown in the diagram below.

<Callout type="warning">

  The order of the payment notifications cannot be guaranteed. For example, a
  client might receive a <code>payment.success</code> notification before a{" "}
  <code>payment.initiated</code> is sent.

### Details for each payment status

<Text>
  <code>Sqr</code>, <code>Dqr</code>, <code>Tpv</code> and <code>Autopay</code>{" "}
  - all of these products raise payment events when a customer interacts with
  the QR code/ intent link generated by Setu and tries to make a payment. The
  payment notification tries to capture all the relevant information about the
  payment and the product on which the payment was made.
</Text>

<Callout type="tip">
  There are some nuances to the notification spec based on the product used.
</Callout>

For TPV, these are the additional attributes in the notification spec -

=======
    The order of the payment notifications cannot be guaranteed. For example, a client might receive a <code>payment.success</code> notification before a <code>payment.initiated</code> is sent.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    For the same <strong>payment transaction</strong> the <code>txnId</code> value will always be the same, you can use this to correlate different events to a unique payment
</Callout>

<hr class="primary"/>

Payment events are common for products like `sqr`, `dqr`, `tpv`, `collect` and `autopay`, any product which is intended to collect funds from a customer will result in a payment event on customer interaction.

While most of the attributes in the notificiation payload are the same for all products, there are some that are conditional.

- `productInstanceType` - depends on the product type, allowed values — `collect`, `pay_single`, `pay_multi`, `pay_single_tpv`, `autopay`

- `txnType` - all intent based payments will be of type `pay`, the rest will be `collect`

- `tpv` — conditional, this object is populated only when the productInstanceType is `pay_single_tpv`
