#### Steps to on-board a merchant

An **aggregator** can seamlessly on-board merchants onto the UMAP ecosystem, and enable them to start accepting UPI payments. This journey starts from collecting a merchantâ€™s business details, setting up their configuration and as the final step activation of the merchantâ€™s ability to process transactions.

###### Step 1 - Share information about merchant

As the first step, the operations team gathers necessary details from the merchant, ensuring that the UMAP system has all the relevant information to proceed with the on-boarding process.

###### Step 2 - Setup a merchant

After getting the merchant's information, a preliminary verification is conducted. Then, a record for the merchant is created in the UMAP system, which formally initiates their on-boarding journey.

</a>

###### Step 3 - Register a VPA
A VPA has to be created for the merchant, before they can start transacting on UMAP. This gives the merchant the capability to accept payments via UPI, completing the on-boarding process. This can include 2 stepsâ€”


**Check if a VPA is available (optional)**

This API helps you check the availability of a desired VPA, to ensure it is unique and can be assigned to the merchant without conflicts.

        target="_self"
    >
        Check VPA availability API â†—
    </a>

**Register VPA (required)**

The next API is used to assign a VPA to the merchant. With this, merchant on-boarding is completed seamlessly! The merchant can now initiate transactions on UPI.

#### Manage your merchants

###### Update merchant status

If a merchant needs to be disabled by an aggregator then they can call this API to update their status. If a merchant is disabled UMAP will decline all transactions to the VPA assigned to this particular merchant.

###### Update merchant details
