### Core concepts for Payment products
UMAP relies on a few features that persist across various products offered under the **Payments** stack. These have been listed below.

<br/>

#### Payment statuses
UMAP has consistent and transparent payment statuses across all transaction flows.

| **Payment statuses** | **Description**                                               |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `payment.initiated`              | Payment has been attempted by a customer          |
| `payment.ending`                 | Payment is currently being processed by UMAP      |
| `payment.success`                | Payment has been successfully completed           |
| `payment.failed`                 | Payment could not be processed                    |

#### Conditional, scenario-based flows

Conditional flows are optional steps that may be executed in response to specific scenarios that arise after a transaction is completed.

These flows ensure that merchants are able to efficiently manage transactions—from initiation to resolution—thus providing a streamlined payment experience for their customers.

###### Dispute retrieval

If a customer raises a dispute regarding a transaction, this API call allows for the retrieval of dispute details using a unique identifier, facilitating timely resolution.

###### Initiate refund

In cases where a dispute arises or as a necessary step in the transaction process, a refund can be initiated. This API, typically prompted by the merchant, reverses the transaction amount to the customer.
