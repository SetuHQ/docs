Once you have been onboarded on to Bridge as an aggregator and business formalities have been completed, you can proceed to integrate UMAP APIs with your internal systems. First, you have to create a merchant and then enable products that the merchant can use.

<hr class="primary" />

#### Step 1 â€” Configure a merchant

As an aggregator on UMAP, you have to first create a merchant by providing their business details and creating a VPA (which associates them to you, the aggregator). After this, you can enable UPI products for the merchant.

  <Text weight="400" marginTop="nano" marginBottom="none" size="small">
    Create your first merchant on UMAP
  </Text>
</Card>

<hr class="primary" />

#### Step 2 â€” Enable UPI products for merchant

Once a merchant has been associated to your aggregator account, you can enable payment/subscription products under UPI payments and UPI mandates, with our APIs.

      <Text weight="400" marginTop="nano" marginBottom="none" size="small">
        Enable UPI payments with Flash, Collect & TPV
      </Text>
    </Card>
  </Portion>
  <Portion desktopSpan="half">
    <Card padding="small" shape="rounded">
      <Link href="payments/umap/mandates">UPI Mandates</Link>
      <Text weight="400" marginTop="nano" marginBottom="none" size="small">
        Enable recurring payments with UPI mandates
      </Text>
    </Card>
  </Portion>
</Row>

<hr class="primary" />

#### Step 3 â€” Manage your merchants

Once you have on-boarded multiple merchants, and enabled products for them, you can also manage your merchants by editing/disabling them directly on Bridge, or through our merchant management APIs.
