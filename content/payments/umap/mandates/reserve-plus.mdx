    link, chooses preferred UPI app / scans the qr on preferred UPI app and
    enters mPIN to initiate single block multi debit mandate creation.
  </li>

    mandate creation initiation which the merchant can use to update single
    block multi debit mandate status at their end.
  </li>
  <li>
    Once the mandate is <b>LIVE</b>, <b>UMAP</b> triggers another webhook
    notification which the merchant can use to mark mandate status as{" "}
