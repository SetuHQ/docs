#### What is a one-time mandate ?

A one time mandate a mandate that can be executed only once at a later date after taking user consent. One time mandates are very useful for conditional flows like:

- IPO mandates that are executed only on allotment of shares
- Transit systems that debit funds only if ticket is confirmed
- Events platforms can use OTMs for RSVP before confirmations

#### How it works

The first step to collect a payment via a one time mandate is for the merchant to create a one time mandate. There are 2 ways in which a one time mandate can be created:

**Intent based :** Intent based mandates are always initiated by user through merchant app or by scanning a QR code.

**Collect based** Collect based mandates are initated by merchant by taking user's VPA as an input and creating a request.
