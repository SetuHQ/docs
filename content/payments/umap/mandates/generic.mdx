## Mandate operations
A UPI mandate itself is not a transaction, but rather a standing instruction on the basis of which transactions are carried out. Therefore, a status of a mandate can change, just like updating an agreement between two parties. 

There are four main operations that can happen on a UPI mandate after creation—
- <a href="/payments/umap/mandates/generic/update">Updating a mandate ↗</a>
- <a href="/payments/umap/mandates/generic/revoke">Revoking a mandate ↗</a>
- <a href="/payments/umap/mandates/generic/pause">Pausing a mandate ↗</a>
- <a href="/payments/umap/mandates/generic/unpause">Un-pausing a paused mandate ↗</a>
