#### How it works

The first step to collect a payment via a recurring mandate is for the **merchant** to create a recurring mandate. There are 2 ways in which a recurring mandate can be created:<br/><br/>
**Intent based :** Intent based mandates are always initiated by user through merchant app or by scanning a QR code.

**Collect based** Collect based mandates are initated by merchant by taking user's VPA as an input and creating a request.
