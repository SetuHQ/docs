### How it works

<hr class="tertiary" />

###### Step 1 â€” Create a recurring mandate

1. **Merchant** sends UPI IPO mandate details to **UPI Setu** and receives a unique recurring mandate creation intent link / QR to send to their Customer
2. **Customer** clicks the recurring mandate creation intent link, chooses the preferred UPI app / scans the QR on the preferred UPI app, and enters mPIN to initiate IPO Mandate Creation.
3. **UPI Setu** triggers a webhook notification on recurring mandate creation initiation which the merchant can use to update recurring mandate status at their end.
4. **UPI Setu**, gets confirmation from NPCI on Mandate Creation, and funds are blocked in the customerâ€™s bank account for the IPO.
5. Once the mandate is **LIVE**, **UPI Setu** triggers another webhook notification which the merchant can use to mark the mandate status as **LIVE** at their end.

###### Mandatory Conditions for UPI IPO

| Condition         | Value |
| ----------------- | ----- |
| MCC code          | 6211  |
| Purpose code      | 01    |
| BlockFunds        | Yes   |
| Mandate frequency | one   |

###### Step 2 - Trigger mandate execution

<Callout type="tip">
  <strong>Merchant</strong> does not have to send any pre-debit notification as
  customer allowing blocking of funds is equivalent to giving consent for
  transaction.
</Callout>

<br />

- **Merchant** triggers a call to the execution API only if IPO is allotted and the customerâ€™s account is debited depending on the level of allocation.

- If IPO is partially allotted, merchant can trigger execution API and specify execution amount according to the value of partially allotted shares.

- If IPO is not allotted to customer, then merchant can cancel the mandate to unblock the customerâ€™s funds

###### Step 3 - Check payment status

**Merchant** can use check payment status API to check payment statuses
associated to the mandate.
