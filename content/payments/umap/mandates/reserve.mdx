### What is a UPI Reserve?

UPI Reserve is a specialized One-Time Mandate product within our UPI Autopay Solution that enables any merchant to provide "Auth & Capture" over UPI.
<br />
Reserve allows a merchant to block funds upto â‚¹1 lakh for all MCCs except 6211 and debit either the full amount or a partial amount from the customer. If a partial debit is done, remaining funds are unblocked in the customer bank A/C without any additional need for refund/reversal.

### How it works

<hr class="tertiary" />

###### Step 1 â€” Create a recurring mandate

1. **Merchant** sends UPI Reserve mandate details to **UPI Setu** and receives a unique one time mandate creation intent link / QR to send to their Customer
2. **Customer** clicks the one-time mandate creation intent link, chooses their UPI app / scans the QR on their UPI app, and enters mPIN to initiate Reserve Creation.
3. **UPI Setu** triggers a webhook notification on one-time mandate creation initiation which the merchant can use to update recurring mandate status at their end.
4. **UPI Setu**, gets confirmation from NPCI on Mandate Creation, and funds are blocked in the customerâ€™s bank account for the Reserve usecase.
5. Once the mandate is **LIVE**, **UPI Setu** triggers another webhook notification which the merchant can use to mark the mandate status as **LIVE** at their end.

###### Step 2 - Trigger mandate execution

<Callout type="tip">
  <strong>Merchant</strong> does not have to send any pre-debit notification as
  customer allowing blocking of funds is equivalent to giving consent for
  transaction.
</Callout>

<br />

- **Merchant** triggers a call to the execution API only if serice is provided and the customerâ€™s account is debited depending on the level of usage.

- If Block is partially used, merchant can trigger execution API and specify execution amount according to the value of partially used funds.

- If Block is not used by customer, then merchant can cancel the mandate to unblock the customerâ€™s funds in their bank account.

###### Step 3 - Check payment status

**Merchant** can use check payment status API to check payment statuses
associated to the mandate.
