<br />

The collect request in UPI is a customer-driven payment mode where the merchant initiates a transaction by providing the customer's Virtual Payment Address (VPA). Upon initiation, the customer receives a notification on their UPI app to authorize the transaction, facilitating a seamless payment completion.

### Step 1 - Verify customer VPA (optional)

In collect, a merchant needs to accept customer vpa as input to create a collect request at customer’s UPI app. The merchant can verify the validity of the vpa input by the customer using this API.

<a

  target="_blank"
>
  <code>Verify customer VPA</code> ↗
</a>

<hr class="primary" />

### Step 2 - Create collect request

A collect product instance is created by the merchant inputting the customer's VPA. This action triggers a collect request, notifying the customer through their UPI app to proceed with the transaction.

<a
  href="/payments/umap/api-reference#/category~collect/operation~collect#create"
  target="_blank"
>
  <code>Create collect request</code> ↗
</a>

<hr class="primary" />

### Step 3 - Retrieve collect request

After the customer responds to the collect request, transaction details can be fetched using a unique identifier or retrieval reference number, enabling merchants to access specific collect request.

<a
  href="/payments/umap/api-reference#/category~collect/operation~collect#fetchById"
  target="_blank"
>
  <code>Fetch by ID</code> ↗
</a>
