## Accept UPI payments with Flash

Merchants can offer their customers a seamless payment experience by utilizing UPI Setu APIs to create UPI intent links. These intent links can either be directly integrated into their applications or converted into QR codes for easy scanning. Below is a detailed guide on how to implement this process:

### Step 1 - Create a QR

In the QR flow, a merchant generates an intent link which can be directly sent to customers, integrated to merchant app or coverted into a QR code which can be scanned by user's UPI app. You can create two types of QR a Dynamic QR and a Static QR.

- `DQR` — can be paid to only once, this is in cases where a one time session based payment is collected. A dynamic QR provides lot more context about the payment than an Static QR, like the amount, transaction note and metadata

- `SQR` — can be paid to multiple times, this is what we usually see printed in every store

  target="_blank"
>
  Generate Static QR ↗
</a>

### Step 2 - Wait for customer to initiate transaction

An intent or QR based payment is always initiated by a customer. This can happen in two ways

- Customer scans a QR code representing the UPI intent link
- Customer is redirected using payment short-link on merchant app

### Step 3 - Retrieve payment details

Following the initiation of the transaction, the system retrieves the payment details. This retrieval is based on the Id of the QR resource, ensuring you have access to transaction information for confirmation and record-keeping.
