## Third party validation

The **Third Party Validation (TPV)** QR introduces an enhanced layer of security to the traditional UPI QR by incorporating a conditional validation check of the customer’s bank account details. This procedure is designed to ensure that payments are made from a bank account that has been previously registered with the merchant, typically during the on-boarding or KYC process.

<Callout type="tip">
The TPV process is a mandatory check required for most <code>capital markets merchants</code> and is mandated by SEBI to ensure that funds are collected from a verified account of the customer only. It can also be beneficial for other use-cases like <strong>insurance, loans and loyalty programs</strong>.

#### Step 1 - Create QR with validation

When creating a QR, merchants have the option to include the **customer's bank account details** as part of the request payload. This additional information is aimed at facilitating the validation process.

>

</a>

Sample bank account validation object—
<CodeBlockWithCopy language="json">
{`{
    "primaryAccount": {
      "IFSC": "SBIN0000001",
      "accountName": "ram",
      "accountNumber": "189038291312"
    },
    "secondaryAccounts": [
      {
          "IFSC": "ICIC0000001",
          "accountName": "shyam",
          "accountNumber": "98412490124"
      }
    ]
}`}
</CodeBlockWithCopy>


<hr class="primary" />

#### Step 2 - Accept or reject a payment

When a customer interacts with a QR or a payment shortlink and tries to make a payment, the **bank account details** provided at the payment stage is compared **real-time** with those supplied by the merchant.

<a
  href="/payments/umap/api-reference#/category~tpv/operation~tpv#fetchById"
  target="_blank"
>
  Fetch QR status ↗
</a>

<br/>
<br/>

<Callout type="tip">
  A payment is <strong>accepted</strong> and the customer's <strong>bank account is debited</strong>, only if the details <strong>match</strong>.
</Callout>

<br/>

Sample reason object, when a payment is rejected—
<CodeBlockWithCopy language="json">
{`{
    "reason": {
      "code": "payment-failed",
      "desc": "account name: mismatch",
      "npciErrCode": "YG",
      "npciErrDesc": "MERCHANT ERROR (PAYEE PSP)",
      "npciErrCategory": "BD"
    }
}`}
</CodeBlockWithCopy>

<hr class="primary" />

#### Step 3 - Retrieve payment details

There are two methods in which the merchant can get the details of the payment made by the customer
- Get notified on payment events with merchant notifications
- Fetch payment history for the QR
