UMAP has a robust notification system to provide a transparent experience for our merchants.

-   <p>Retries to ensure notification delivery to customers</p>
-   <p>Coverage of statuses across all financial and non-financial flows</p>
-   <p>Configurable notification endpoints at merchant and aggregator levels</p>

### What are events?

<Text>Whenever the <code>state</code> of a resource(type of a transaction record) changes on our platform, an <strong>event</strong> gets raised. For example, when a customer tries to make a payment on dynamic QR, a <code>payment.initiated</code> event is raised. Merchants can subscribe to these events to get timely updates on current state of a transaction.</Text>

Events are categorized based on the resources on top of which they are raised, they are

- **<a href="/payments/umap/notifications/customer-vpa-verification" target="_self">customer_vpa â†—</a>**
- **<a href="/payments/umap/notifications/payments" target="_self">payment â†—</a>**
- **<a href="/payments/umap/notifications/mandates" target="_self">mandate â†—</a>**
- **<a href="/payments/umap/notifications/refunds" target="_self">refund â†—</a>**
- **<a href="/payments/umap/notifications/disputes" target="_self">dispute â†—</a>**

Every notification sent to the merchant follows the same base payload as seen below, 
- `resource` and the `status` together form the `eventType`
- `eventId` is unique for every event notification sent to the merchant
- `eventTs` records the time at the event was triggered

<CodeBlockWithCopy language="json">
{`{
    "eventType": "payment.initiated",
    "eventId": "01ARZ3NDEKTSV4RRFFQ69G5FAV",
    "eventTs": "2023-09-04T12:08:20+0530",
    "resource": "payment",
    "status": "initiated"
}`}
</CodeBlockWithCopy>

In addition to these attributes, based on the `eventType` more attributes get added


### Subscribing to events

A Merchant can recieve status updates by registering a callback URL and subscribing certain events under it. Though merchants can configure any number of callback URLs, an event can be subscribed to only once at a merchant level.

<Callout type="tip">
Did you miss a notification because of a downtime? You don't have to be worried.
<br/>
<br/>
If any of our notifications to the merchant fail, we retry the notification 3 times
    with an exponential backoff strategy, the backoff interval is 3 minutes
