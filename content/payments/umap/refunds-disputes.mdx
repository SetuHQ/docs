UMAP empowers merchants with direct API access to issue refunds and contest disputes efficiently, by leveraging NPCI's default framework. This streamlines communication and resolution processes, ensuring merchants have control and visibility over transaction reversals and customer disputes, which in turn helps to resolve customer issues and maintain high levels of satisfaction.

###### Step 1 - Issue refunds
Merchants can initiate refunds through the <a href="/payments/umap/api-reference#/category~refund/operation~refund#create" target="_blank">create refund API</a> by submitting the details of the original transaction. UMAP coordinates with NPCI to process the refund, ensuring the amount is returned to the customer's account.

Throughout the refund process, UMAP provides merchants
with timely updates regarding the refund status,
ensuring transparency and allowing merchants to keep
their customers informed.

UMAP also sends notifications to the merchants for the following eventsâ€”
- `refund_success`
- `refund_failed`

###### Step 2 - Check refund status
In addition to notifications, merchants can also use the <a href="/payments/umap/api-reference#/category~refund/operation~refund#fetchById" target="_blank">check refund status API</a> to check if a refund is successful.

**Refund statuses**
- `refund_initiated` Refund request has been
created at UMAP
- `refund_pending` Refund is in queue for processing
- `refund_successful` Refund has been
successfully completed
- `refund_failed` Refund could not be
processed

### Dispute resolution overview
The UMAP platform's seamless integration with the UDIR
framework ensures that merchants can provide prompt and
efficient resolutions to disputes, safeguarding both
their interests and those of their customers.

###### Step 1 - Initiation of dispute by customer
Disputes are initiated by customers and communicated to UMAP via NPCI. Next, UMAP promptly notifies the merchant with dispute details.

UMAP sends notifications to merchants for the following events
- `dispute_created`

###### Step 2 - Respond to dispute as a merchant
As a merchant, you have the option to either accept or reject the dispute through UMAP. 

**Accepting a dispute**â€”Agreeing to the dispute automatically triggers a refund to the customer for the disputed transaction.

**Rejecting a dispute**â€”Contesting a dispute, requires you to provide transaction evidence, such as an invoice, which UMAP forwards to
NPCI for review.
- If the review process favors the merchant, the dispute is closed with no requirement for refund.
- If the merchant loses the dispute, a refund is issued to the customer for the disputed transaction.

**Dispute statuses**
- `dispute_open`&nbsp;A dispute has been created
by a customer
- `dispute_closed`&nbsp;Merchant accepted the dispute
and issued a refund
- `dispute_in_review`&nbsp;Merchant has contested
dispute and has provided evidence
- `dispute_won`&nbsp;Merchant evidence accepted and no refund required
- `dispute_lost`&nbsp;Merchant evidence rejected and refund is issued
