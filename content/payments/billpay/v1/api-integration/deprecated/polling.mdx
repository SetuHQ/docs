## API Polling

<Callout type="error">
    This set of APIs has been deprecated. It is recommended to use{" "}
    <a href="/payments/billpay/api-integration">these APIs</a> instead.
</Callout>
<br />

BillPay COU APIs are asynchronous and require a polling mechanism to retrieve results. The duration for the intervals between polling and end states are documented below.

<Callout type="warning">
    We strongly recommend using a persistent queue like RabbitMQ to process
    these APIs.
</Callout>

### Flowchart for polling logic

These APIs are mandatory to consume, and asynchronous and dependent on each other. The APIs that require polling logic—

### Bill fetch APIs

The Bill Fetch APIs are used to retrieve outstanding bills from a biller. These are the `bill-fetch-request` and `get-fetched-bill` APIs.

The `context` from the response for `bill-fetch-request` has to be passed as the request for `get-fetched-bill`.

The `get-fetched-bill` API must be called 5 secs after a successful `bill-fetch-request`—

-   If the `fetchAPIStatus`, from response of `get-fetched-bill`, is `Acknowledged` it means that the request is still processing. You'll need to re-hit the `get-fetched-bill` with the same context again after 5 secs and wait for `fetchAPIStatus` to become `Active`.
-   If the `fetchAPIStatus` does not become `Active` after retrying the same for 1 minute you can terminate the bill fetch and display an error.

<Callout type="tip">
    If either <code>bill-fetch-request</code> or <code>get-fetched-bill</code>{" "}
    has an error/timeout and does NOT give a response, you can retry the APIs
    with the same request body.
</Callout>
<br />

If `fetchAPIStatus`, from `get-fetched-bill` response is—

-   `Acknowledged`—The request is still processing. Retry after 5 secs.
-   `Cancelled`—The request has finished processing but there was an error. You can display the provided error message.
-   `Rejected`—The request finished processing but there was an error. You can display the provided error message.
-   `Active`—The request has finished processing successfully. You can display the bill and redirect the user to payment screens.

<hr class="primary" />

### Make payment APIs

The `make-payment` and `get-payment-status` APIs are used to complete payment for outstanding bills of a biller.

The `context` from the response of `get-fetched-bill` has to be passed as the request for `make-payment`. Similarly, `context` from the response of `make-payment` has to be passed as the request for `get-payment-status`.

The `get-payment-status` API must be called 5 secs after a successful `make-payment` call—

-   If the status from the response of `get-payment-status` is `Execution Awaited` it means the request is still processing. You'll need to re-hit `get-payment-status` with the same context again after 5 secs and wait for status to become `Settled` or `Cancelled` or `Rejected`.
-   If the `status` does not go into an end state after retrying the same for 5 minutes, you can retry the `get-payment-status` with the same context again once every 5 minutes till it goes to an end state.
    If the end state is not `Settled` or `Cancelled` or `Rejected` even after 1 day, please contact us at <a href="https://setu.co/support" target="_blank">Setu Support</a>.

<Callout type="tip">
    If the <code>make-payment</code> API errors/timeouts and does NOT give a
    response you can pass the <code>context</code> used in the{" "}
    <code>make-payment</code> request body as the <code>context</code> for{" "}
    <code>get-payment-status</code> request.
    <br />
    <br />
    This will help you identify if the payment in question has been registered with
    the BBPS system.
</Callout>

<br />

<Callout type="error">
    Never call the <code>make-payment</code> API multiple times for the same
    context as it may result in your account getting debitted multiple times.
</Callout>

<br />

If the `get-payment-status` API errors/times out and does not give a response you can retry with the same request body.

If `status`, obtained in the response of `get-payment-status` is—

-   `Execution Awaited`—The request is still processing. Please retry after 5 secs.
-   `Cancelled`—The request has finished processing but there was an error. You can display the provided error message.
-   `Rejected`—The request has finished processing but there was an error. You can display the provided error message.
-   `Settled`—The request has finished processing successfully. You can display the receipt for your user.
