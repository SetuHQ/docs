## BBPS BillPay

### What is BBPS?

BBPS, or Bharat Bill Payment System allows customers to pay 20k+ businesses across categories like utility bills, loan EMIs, school fees, and more—using a network of offline and online agents.

### Who is an agent?

An agent is a registered BBPS entity allowed to collect payments for BBPS billers across all categories.

You may register as an agent on BBPS, to collect BBPS bill payments with Setu APIs on your supported collection channels (offline or online).

### What can I do with this product?

With Setu BillPay, you can enable a complete BBPS bill payment experience for your customers—from choosing business to pay, to fetching and paying bills—on your app or website. If you are a BBPS biller, you can even collect payments to your business directly.

Setu BBPS BillPay connects with NPCI and provides simple RESTful APIs, some of which are asynchronous. This means that you may choose to consume
only the APIs or optionally subscribe to the notifications Setu provides via webhooks.

You may integrate with Setu in any of the following ways—
