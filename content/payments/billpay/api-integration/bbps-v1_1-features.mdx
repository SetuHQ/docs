# BBPS V1.1 Features Guide

## Overview

This guide covers advanced BBPS V1.1 features for multi-bill processing and flexible payment configurations.

📖 **For basic payment integration and API fundamentals → [Paying Bills Integration Guide](./paying_bills.mdx)**

Setu's BBPS BillPay APIs have been upgraded to align with BBPS V1.1 specifications, introducing powerful new capabilities that enhance flexibility and user experience in bill payment processing. This comprehensive guide covers all new features, implementation patterns, and best practices.

### Key Highlights

BBPS V1.1 introduces three major enhancements:

1. **🔧 Flexible Amount Configuration** - Sophisticated payment amount controls with min/max ranges and increment specifications
2. **💳 Multiple Payment Options** - Support for various payment modes within a single bill (advance payments, partial payments, foreclosure options)
3. **📦 Bulk Operations** - Ability to fetch and process multiple bills simultaneously for streamlined B2B and corporate scenarios

<br/>

## What's New in V1.1

### Enhanced Payment Flexibility
- Dynamic amount restrictions with `minAmount`, `maxAmount`, and `amountMultiple` controls
- Custom labels for improved bill identification and user experience
- Support for partial payments, advance payments, and custom payment structures

### Multi-Bill Support
- Fetch multiple bills in a single API call
- Configurable selection types (single, multiple, or all bills)
- Optimized for corporate credit cards, utility bundles, and B2B payment scenarios

### Improved Transaction Tracking
- Detailed bill-level information in transaction histories
- Enhanced reporting capabilities for multi-bill payments
- Better reconciliation support for complex payment scenarios

<br/>

## Biller Configuration & Attributes

Understanding biller attributes is crucial for implementing the correct payment flow. These attributes are returned in the **List Billers API** response and determine how bill fetch and payment operations should be handled.

### Response Type

The `responseType` attribute defines the bill return behavior:

| Type | Description | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `SINGLE` | Returns zero or one bill per fetch request | Traditional utility bills, individual account payments |
| `LIST` | Can return multiple bills in a single fetch | Corporate accounts, bundled services, family plans |

<br/>

### Selection Type

For `LIST` billers, the `selectionType` specifies payment flexibility:

| Type | Description | Payment Behavior |
|------|-------------|------------------|
| `SINGLE` | Pay one bill from the list | Choose specific bill from multiple options |
| `MULTIPLE` | Pay any combination of bills | Flexible multi-bill payment |
| `ALL` | Must pay all returned bills | Mandatory bundle payment |

<br />

### Configuration Examples

#### Single Bill Biller

<CodeBlockWithCopy language="json">{`
{
    "id": "ELEC001",
    "name": "State Electricity Board",
    "responseType": "SINGLE",
    "selectionType": null,
}
`}</CodeBlockWithCopy>


#### Multi-bill Single Selection Biller

<CodeBlockWithCopy language="json">{`
{
    "id": "ELEC001",
    "name": "State Electricity Board",
    "responseType": "LIST",
    "selectionType": "SINGLE",
}
`}</CodeBlockWithCopy>


#### Multi-Bill Flexible Biller

<CodeBlockWithCopy language="json">{`
{
    "id": "CORP001", 
    "name": "Corporate Credit Card",
    "responseType": "LIST",
    "selectionType": "MULTIPLE",
}
`}</CodeBlockWithCopy>

#### Bundle Payment Biller

<CodeBlockWithCopy language="json">{`
{
    "id": "BUNDLE001",
    "name": "Telecom Bundle Services",
    "responseType": "LIST", 
    "selectionType": "ALL",
}
`}</CodeBlockWithCopy>


### Payment Amount Exactness

The `exactness` field controls payment amount flexibility:

| Type | Description | Implementation |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| `EXACT` | Must pay the exact bill amount | Standard bill payment |

> **💡 Key Insight:**  The `exactness` field now includes a new option `RANGE`. For `RANGE`, you must use the `minAmount` and `maxAmount` fields (if present) in the bill fetch response to set the allowable payment range.

<br/>

## Implementation Patterns

### Pattern 1: Single Bill Processing

**Use Case:** Traditional utility bills, individual account payments

#### Biller Configuration

## Amount Configuration

BBPS V1.1 introduces flexible amount configuration for bills. This allows billers to set specific constraints on payment amounts.

### New Fields

The bill fetch response now includes the following new fields for each bill:

| Field | Purpose | Usage |
|-------|---------|-------|
| `label` | Human-readable bill description | Display to users for better bill identification |
| `minAmount` | Minimum payable amount | Enforce minimum payment threshold |
| `maxAmount` | Maximum payable amount | Enforce maximum payment threshold |
| `amountMultiple` | Required payment increments | Ensure payments in specific denominations |

<br />

### Using New Fields

#### label
> **Purpose**: Display this text to provide additional context about the bill
> 
> **Usage**: Optional descriptive text that appears alongside the bill information


#### amountMultiple
> **Purpose**: Ensure the payment amount is a multiple of this value
> 
> **Example**: If `amountMultiple` is 100, valid payments could be:
> - ✅ 100, 200, 300, 400...
> - ❌ 150, 250, 350...


#### minAmount & maxAmount

| Scenario | Rule | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| **Both present** | `minAmount ≤ payment ≤ maxAmount` | Allow payments only within this range |
| **Only minAmount** | `payment ≥ minAmount` | Allow payments at or above this amount |
| **Only maxAmount** | `payment ≤ maxAmount` | Allow payments at or below this amount |
| **Neither present** | No restrictions | Allow any payment amount |

<br />

### Additional Notes

In all scenarios, the `amount` field represents the actual bill amount. The constraints (`minAmount`, `maxAmount`, `amountMultiple`) define the acceptable payment amounts, which may differ from the bill amount.

#### Validation Rules

Validate payment amounts using these rules:

- If `minAmount` is set: `payment >= minAmount`
- If `maxAmount` is set: `payment <= maxAmount`  
- If `amountMultiple` is set: `payment % amountMultiple == 0`

#### Additional Constraints

- **Effective minAmount** = `max(billMinAmount, paymentChannel minAmount, paymentMode minAmount)`
- **Effective maxAmount** = `min(billMaxAmount, paymentChannel maxAmount, paymentMode maxAmount)`

### Multiple Bills Support

All the amount configuration rules and implementation guidelines discussed above apply equally to scenarios where the fetch response contains multiple bill objects or single bill object in bills array.

#### Handling Multiple Bills

When handling multiple bills:

- Apply the validation rules to each bill individually
- Ensure that the total payment amount respects the constraints of all selected bills
- Allow users to select and pay for multiple bills based on the biller's `selectionType`

<br/>

## Payment Options

A new field called `paymentOptions` may be included in each bill within the `bills` array of the bill fetch response. This field appears when the biller provides multiple payment methods for a single bill.

### Attributes

Each payment option in the `paymentOptions` array may contain the following attributes:

- **name**: A descriptive name for the payment option (required)
- **amount**: The suggested amount for this payment option (optional)
- **minAmount**: The minimum amount allowed for this option (optional)
- **maxAmount**: The maximum amount allowed for this option (optional)
- **amountMultiple**: The multiple in which the amount should be paid (optional)

## Selecting a Payment Option

The `selectedPaymentOptions` field in the payment request is used to specify which payment option the user has chosen, if any.

This feature is currently only available for single billers (single bill scenarios).

### Use Cases

#### Paying Base Bill Amount (No Payment Options Selected)

1. It can be null or empty when paying the base bill amount.
2. When no specific option is selected, the base bill amount's constraints (`minAmount`, `maxAmount`, `amountMultiple`) apply.

<br />

#### Paying for a Specific Option

Only one of the payment options specified in the fetch response can be selected:

- The `name` in `selectedPaymentOptions[0]` must match a name from the fetch response's `paymentOptions`.
- The `amount` in `selectedPaymentOptions[0]` must:
  - Match `paymentDetails.amount`
  - Adhere to `minAmount`, `maxAmount`, and `amountMultiple` of the corresponding option in the fetch response (if provided).

## Getting details of paid bills

The List Transactions API response now includes a new `bills` array element, providing detailed information about the bills involved in each transaction.

### Response

The `bills` array in the List Transactions API response contains objects with `billNumber` and `amount` for each bill involved in the transaction.

### Examples

#### LIST Transactions

1. The `bills` array in the response matches the `bills` array from the payment request.
2. It includes bills paid in the transaction (as present in payment request), regardless of the selection type.
