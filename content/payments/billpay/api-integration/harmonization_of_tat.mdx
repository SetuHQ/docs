# Harmonization of TAT - Dispute APIs Documentation

## Overview

This document details the enhancements made to the dispute APIs to incorporate the recent harmonization of Turn Around Time (TAT) guidelines, commonly referred to as Ticket API changes. These updates ensure alignment with the standardized TAT framework while maintaining the existing dispute management workflow. Users can continue raising tickets using the current dispute APIs without any modifications to the request or submission process.


## API Changes

## Business Rules

### Cooling Period Requirements

Different transaction types have specific cooling period requirements:

- **FASTag, DTH and Mobile Prepaid**: Tickets can be raised immediately after transaction completion
- **Utilities and other categories**: 24-hour cooling period required from transaction creation timestamp


## API Examples

### Request Example

<CodeBlockWithCopy language="json">{`
{
  "transactionId": "DP015080142106KQkKly",
  "disputeType": "account-not-updated", 
  "description": "I have paid but account is not updated"
}
`}</CodeBlockWithCopy>


### Response Example


<CodeBlockWithCopy language="json">{`
{
  "data": {
    "assignedTo": "BBPCU",
    "disposition": "D32",
    "disputeId": "TKTCVEJDCOH215KV2761CLGxwrzHMI50801521",
    "refId": "CVEJET77GM8365VO5HRGtokm7MX50801525",
    "remarks": "Belongs to BOU",
    "responseReason": "Success",
    "status": "PENDING_REFUND",
    "ticketTAT": "2025-03-22",
    "ticketType": "DISPUTE"
  },
  "success": true,
  "traceId": "CVEJNK8H215KV2761F50"
}
`}</CodeBlockWithCopy>


## Implementation Notes

1. **Backward compatibility**: Existing dispute API endpoints remain functional
2. **Webhook updates**: All webhook/callback responses now include the new fields
3. **Validation**: System validates cooling period requirements before allowing ticket creation
4. **TAT tracking**: `ticketTAT` field provides clear resolution timeline expectations
