# Customer Convenience Fee (CCF) Integration Guide

## 1. Some Billers Charge Customer Convenience Fee (CCF)

Customer Convenience Fee (CCF) is an additional charge some billers impose on top of the bill amount—essentially a fee your users pay for the convenience of digital bill payment through BBPS.

You'll discover CCF when calling the <a href="/payments/billpay/api-integration/api-reference#/category~List/operation~getBillers" target="_blank">List Billers API</a>, where it appears in the biller's metadata. Here's what CCF looks like in biller responses:

<CodeBlockWithCopy language="json">{`
{
  "id": "SOME00000NATRR",
  "name": "Some Bank NCMC Pune Metro",
  "interchangeFee": [
    {
      "feeCode": "CCF1",
      "feeDesc": "Customer_Convenience_Fee",
      "feeDirection": "C2B",
      "interchangeFeeDetails": {
        "effctvFrom": "2023-07-28",
        "effctvTo": "",
        "flatFee": 100,        // ₹1.00 in paise
        "percentFee": 0,       // No percentage component
        "tranAmtRangeMax": 999999999999,
        "tranAmtRangeMin": 1
      }
    }
  ]
}
`}</CodeBlockWithCopy>

## 2. What CCF Means for Your Users

When a biller charges CCF, your users pay more than just the bill amount. For example, if someone's metro card recharge is ₹500 and the CCF is ₹1, they'll be debited ₹501 total. Your application needs to clearly communicate this additional cost and handle it correctly in payment requests.

**Key principle**: CCF is always separate from the bill amount in your payment request—never add it to `paymentDetails.amount`, always include it as `paymentDetails.custConvFee`.

## 3. Most Billers Have Zero CCF

Before diving into complex calculations, understand that most billers on the BBPS network charge zero CCF. Many billers will have CCF entries in their metadata with `flatFee: 0` and `percentFee: 0`, which means no additional charge.

**Zero CCF examples:**
<CodeBlockWithCopy language="json">{`
{
  "feeCode": "CCF1",
  "feeDirection": "C2B",
  "interchangeFeeDetails": {
    "flatFee": 0,           // No flat fee
    "percentFee": 0,        // No percentage fee
    "tranAmtRangeMax": 9999999999,
    "tranAmtRangeMin": 1
  }
}
`}</CodeBlockWithCopy>

**When CCF is zero**, you can omit the `custConvFee` field entirely from your payment request.

## 4. When CCF Actually Applies (Real Examples)

Some categories of billers do charge meaningful CCF. Here are some examples from the BBPS network:
Note: The values are for illustration purposes only.

### 4.1 National Pension System (₹0.50 CCF)

        "percentFee": 0,        // No percentage component
        "tranAmtRangeMax": 999999999999,
        "tranAmtRangeMin": 1
      }

        "percentFee": 0,        // No percentage component
        "tranAmtRangeMax": 999999999999,
        "tranAmtRangeMin": 1
      }
    }
  ]
}
`}</CodeBlockWithCopy>

        "effctvTo": "",
        "flatFee": 0,           // No CCF charged
        "percentFee": 0,        // No percentage component
        "tranAmtRangeMax": 9999999999,
        "tranAmtRangeMin": 1
      }
    }
  ]
}
`}</CodeBlockWithCopy>

## 5. How to Calculate and Implement CCF

### 5.1 Detection Logic

Look for `CCF1` + `C2B` entries in the `interchangeFee` array. Zero CCF has two forms, **check for both**:

1. **Missing** - No `CCF1`/`C2B` entry at all → Zero CCF
2. **Present but inactive** - Entry exists with `flatFee: 0` AND `percentFee: 0` → Zero CCF

If either is true, you may omit `custConvFee` from your payment request. If a `CCF1`/`C2B` entry exists with any non-zero fee, calculate the CCF using the formula in section 5.2.

### 5.2 CCF Calculation Formula

When CCF applies, use this formula to calculate the fee in paise:

**Formula**: `ccf = (flatFee + (billAmount × percentFee/100)) × (1 + GST/100)`

**Note**: Currently, GST is 18% on CCF in the BBPS network. (Might change in future)

### 5.3 Real Calculation Examples

**Example 1: National Pension System (₹2000 contribution)**
- Bill amount: ₹2000 (200000 paise)
- CCF: flatFee = 50, percentFee = 0
- Calculation: `(50 + (200000 × 0/100)) × (1 + 18/100) = 50 × 1.18 = 59 paise`
- Total debit: ₹2000.59

**Example 2: HDFC NCMC (₹500 recharge)**
- Bill amount: ₹500 (50000 paise)
- CCF: flatFee = 100, percentFee = 0
- Calculation: `(100 + (50000 × 0/100)) × (1 + 18/100) = 100 × 1.18 = 118 paise`
- Total debit: ₹501.18

**Example 3: Zero CCF biller (₹1500 bill)**
- Bill amount: ₹1500 (150000 paise)
- CCF: flatFee = 0, percentFee = 0
- Calculation: CCF = 0
- Total debit: ₹1500 (omit custConvFee field)

## 6. Building Your Payment Request

### 6.1 Payment Request with CCF

When CCF applies, include it as a separate `custConvFee` field:

<CodeBlockWithCopy language="json">{`
{
  "refId": "FETCH_REF_123",
  "paymentDetails": {
    "amount": 200000,           // Bill amount: ₹2000 in paise
    "custConvFee": 59,          // CCF: ₹0.59 in paise (separate field)
    "mode": "UPI",
    "paymentRefId": "PAY_REF_456",
    "timestamp": "2024-06-04T14:30:00+05:30",
    "accountInfo": "user@ybl"
  },
  "remitter": { "name": "John Doe" }
}
`}</CodeBlockWithCopy>

**Total debit from user**: `paymentDetails.amount + paymentDetails.custConvFee = 200059 paise (₹2000.59)`

### 6.2 Payment Request without CCF

When CCF is zero, omit the `custConvFee` field entirely:

<CodeBlockWithCopy language="json">{`
{
  "refId": "FETCH_REF_123",
  "paymentDetails": {
    "amount": 150000,           // Bill amount: ₹1500 in paise
    // No custConvFee field when CCF is zero
    "mode": "UPI",
    "paymentRefId": "PAY_REF_789",
    "timestamp": "2024-06-04T14:30:00+05:30",
    "accountInfo": "user@ybl"
  },
  "remitter": { "name": "John Doe" }
}
`}</CodeBlockWithCopy>

**Total debit from user**: `paymentDetails.amount = 150000 paise (₹1500)`

## 7. Edge Cases and Important Rules

### 7.1 What to Ignore

**Ignore EBF and PBF fees**: Only handle `CCF1` with `C2B` direction. Electronic Biller Fee (EBF) and Physical Biller Fee (PBF) with `B2C` direction are not customer charges.

### 7.2 Zero CCF Handling

When calculated CCF is zero, you can omit the `custConvFee` field from your payment request.

### 7.3 CCF with Payment Options

When using payment options (alternative amounts), calculate CCF on the final selected amount (`paymentDetails.amount`), not the base bill amount.

## 8. Complete Implementation Checklist

- **Detect CCF**: Look for `CCF1` entries with `C2B` direction in biller metadata
- **Calculate properly**: Use the complete formula including 18% GST
- **Handle zero CCF**: Omit `custConvFee` field when CCF is zero
- **Separate from bill amount**: Never add CCF to `paymentDetails.amount`
- **Calculate on final amount**: For payment options, use selected amount not base amount
- **Ignore irrelevant fees**: Skip EBF/PBF entries (they're biller fees, not customer fees)
- **Communicate clearly**: Show users the total debit amount (bill + CCF) upfront

## 9. User Experience Considerations

**Transparency**: Always show users the CCF amount separately before payment:
- "Bill Amount: ₹500.00"
- "Convenience Fee: ₹1.18"
- "**Total: ₹501.18**"
