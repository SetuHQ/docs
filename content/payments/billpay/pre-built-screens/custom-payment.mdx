## Enabling your payment gateway

Setu’s pre-built screens solution supports UPI payments by default. However, you may want to integrate with your existing payment gateway, and these guides to enable you to do just that.

### How to integrate

#### Product flow

<Row>
    <Portion desktopSpan="7">
        <p>
            This gives an overview of how the payment flow works when a customer
            is interacting with Setu’s pre-built screen solution—
        </p>
    </Portion>
    <Portion desktopSpan="1"> </Portion>
    <Portion desktopSpan="16">
        <img
            style={{ marginTop: "0" }}
            src="https://storage.googleapis.com/strapi-assets/latest/custom_payment_flow_a2c7f649e9/custom_payment_flow_a2c7f649e9.png"
        />
    </Portion>
</Row>

#### Server communication

You need to call the following APIs—

1. <a
       href="/payments/billpay/api-reference/white-label#/category~Link_Generation/operation~EtherealLinkRequest"
       target="_blank"
   >
       Create one time link
   </a>
2. <a
       href="/payments/billpay/api-reference/white-label#/category~CustomPaymentWebhook/operation~CouCustomPaymentWebhook"
       target="_blank"
   >
       Confirm payment
   </a>{" "}

The following APIs need to be supported by you—

1. Get payment status by order ID
2. Refund transaction by order ID
3. Receive events

Please read more on required APIs <a href="/payments/billpay/custom-payment/apis" target="_blank">here</a>.
