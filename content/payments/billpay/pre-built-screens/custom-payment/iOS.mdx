## iOS integration with your own payment gateway

<Callout type="tip">
  This quickstart explains how to integrate when you opt for your own payment
  gateway. Use{" "}
  <a href="/payments/billpay/quickstart/iOS" target="_blank">
    this guide
  </a>{" "}
  for Setu’s default UPI payment option.
</Callout>

<br />

Setu provides ready to use URLs for iOS integration. Contact Setu to update your logo, colours, fonts as per your branding. You can reach out to <a href="">billpay.support@setu.co</a> for any further clarifications. This quickstart page provides the sample code for the following specs—

- **Programming language** — Swift 5.\* (Latest version 5.3)
- **Interface** — Storyboard
- **Life Cycle delegation** — UI Kit
- **iOS versions supported** — 12+ (Latest version 14.4)

### Step 1 — Implement web view in your app

The following steps need to be taken for webview integration—

1. Get link from the backend
2. Open the link in `WKWebView` and attach a `userContentController`
3. Execute payment flow and redirect back to the `WKWebView` on success/failure

<hr class="tertiary" />

##### Get link from the backend

This step gives a one time Setu URL to be used by your customer for the bill fetch or payment flow. The <a href="/payments/billpay/api-reference/white-label#/category~Link/operation~getLink" target="_blank">Create link API</a> needs to be called when Android app wants to obtain a one time link to load Setu’s screen flow inside a webview.

<Callout type="tip">
  None of the parameters aside from mobile number are mandatory, but depending
  on what is passed the returned link will display different UI.
</Callout>

<br />

You can have the following scenarios—

- If no other input is passed, it will take the user to the home page with all BBPS categories.
- If category code is passed, it will show user a list of billers in that category.
- If category code and biller ID is passed, it will show the bill fetch form where a customer can enter their identifers (biller specified parameters)
- If the category code, biller ID and parameters are passed, it will show the bill directly.

<Callout type="warning">
  All query parameters should be url-encoded to escape special characters
</Callout>

The above request will return URL based on the input params. Here’s a sample—

<CodeBlockWithCopy language="json">
  {`{
  "link": "https://cou-whitelabelled-dev.setu.co/cou/categories/5f1fb0db-b2ed-4222-bb2f-53d238df370a"
}`}
</CodeBlockWithCopy>

<hr class="tertiary" />

##### Switch control from your app to Setu

The link returned by the API should be loaded within `WKWebView` in a `ViewController` which implements `UIViewController`, and `WKScriptMessageHandler`. The controller must also extend and use a custom `WKNavigationDelegate` class to intercept and download PDF files.

The `userContentController` will need to implement two functions—

- `initiate_payment` — Used to initiate payment and transfer control from webview to iOS application
- `unload` — Used by the parent app to dismiss the webview

<CodeBlockWithCopy language="bash">
{`// The iOS observer function
func userContentController(_ userContentController: WKUserContentController, didReceive message: WKScriptMessage) {
    guard let dict = message.body as ? [String: AnyObject]
    else {
        return
    }
    let functionToPerform: String = dict["function"] as ? String ?? ""
    
    switch functionToPerform {
        case "initiate_payment":
        let successLink = dict["data"]?["callback"] as! String
        let remarks = dict["data"]?["remarks"] as! String
        let billAmount = dict["data"]?["amount"] as! String
        let orderID = dict["data"]?["orderId"] as! String
        let beneficiaryVPA = dict["data"]?["beneficiaryVPA"] as! String
        
        let vc = PaymentViewController(
          successLink: successLink + successParams,
          remarks: remarks,
          billAmount: billAmount,
          orderID: orderID,
          beneficiaryVPA: beneficiaryVPA
        )
        
        let navVC = UINavigationController(rootViewController: vc)
        present(navVC, animated: true)
        case "unload": closeView()
        default: break
    }
}`}

</CodeBlockWithCopy>

The `WKWebviewDownloadHelper` which downloads our PDF file is used as below

<CodeBlockWithCopy language="bash">
  {`override func viewDidLoad() {
  super.viewDidLoad()
  let mimeTypes = [MimeType(type: "pdf", fileExtension: "pdf")]
  helper = WKWebviewDownloadHelper(webView: webView, mimeTypes: mimeTypes, delegate: self)
  webView.configuration.userContentController.add(self, name: "ios_observer")
}`}
</CodeBlockWithCopy>

`WKWebviewDownloadHelper` is dependent on the custom `WKNavigationDelegate` class

<CodeBlockWithCopy language="bash">
  {`extension WebViewController: WKWebViewDownloadHelperDelegate {
  func fileDownloadedAtURL(url: URL) {
    DispatchQueue.main.async {
      let activityVC = UIActivityViewController(activityItems: [url], applicationActivities: nil)
      activityVC.popoverPresentationController?.sourceView = self.view
      activityVC.popoverPresentationController?.sourceRect = self.view.frame
      activityVC.popoverPresentationController?.barButtonItem = self.navigationItem.rightBarButtonItem
      self.present(activityVC, animated: true, completion: nil)
    }
  }
}`}
</CodeBlockWithCopy>

<hr class="tertiary" />

##### Handle payment flow

The `initiate_payment` case in the the `userContentController` takes the following parameters

- `orderId` on the Setu COU System. Example— `Z7pFtTgr9LtO`
- `amount` to be paid by the customer: Example— `3522.20`
- `callback` which needs to be loaded if the payment is completed. Example—`//bills.setu.co/cou/payment-callback/68c7217b-8fa7-4c1f-8e5f-317ff3027668`
- `beneficiaryVPA` to which amount is to be transferred—this is relevant only if you can transfer in real time using UPI rails.
- `remarks` used to communicate information between mobile app and webview

When `initiate_payment` case is called by the `webview`, your app needs to do the following—

1. Remove the webview
2. Initiate the payment flow
3. Send Setu the webhook event for payment—this need not be done for UPI transfers in real time
4. Once payment is executed, load the webview again for callback URL

<Callout type="warning">
  Note that any <code>ViewController</code> relating to the payment flow, will
  need to set the property <code>isModalInPresentation</code> as{" "}
  <code>true</code>—to prevent user from scrolling back to the previous screen
  while the transfer of control is in process.
</Callout>

<hr class="primary" />

### Step 2 — Optionally configure webhook

You may optionally want to listen to user events—like successful or failed bill fetch, bill payment status and more—through webhooks. Refer to <a href="/payments/billpay/user-events" target="_blank">this guide</a> for more information.

<hr class="primary" />

### Step 3 — Get Production credentials and go live

Once you are done testing your integration, ensure that all KYC and legal agreements are submitted. Contact Setu for getting enabled on production.
