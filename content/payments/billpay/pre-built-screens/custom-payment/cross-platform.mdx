## Cross platform integration with your own payment gateway

<Callout type="tip">
    This quickstart explains how to integrate when you opt for your own payment
    gateway. Use{" "}

In case you are using a cross platform solution—like **Flutter, React Native, Ionic**—for your Android and iOS apps, you can refer to the code snippets provided below for a custom payment integration. The integration process remains the same, but changes as per the language you use.

The code snippets provided below deal specifically with how the web view is loaded and dismissed within your Android/iOS app. Usage of the Create Link API will remain unaffected.

### Flutter

#### Step 1 - Implement webview in your app

The following steps need to be taken for webview integration—

1. Get link from the backend
2. Open the link in `InAppWebView` and attach a `WebViewController`
3. Execute payment flow and redirect back to the `InWebView` post payment

##### Switch control from your app to Setu

The link returned by the <a href="/payments/billpay/api-reference/white-label#/category~Link_Generation/operation~EtherealLinkRequest" target="_blank">Create link API</a> should be loaded within the Webview. Our sample below uses the [flutter_inappwebview](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_inappwebview) plugin for webviews. Feel free to use a plugin as per your requirements.

The `controller` will need to implement two JavaScript handlers - 

- `initiatePayment` - Used to initiate payment & transfer control from Setu webview to the flutter application.
- `unload` - Used by the parent app to dismiss the webview

<Callout type="tip">
    <b>Special use case:</b> This <code>unload</code> function can also be used for dismissing the webview and redirecting a user back to your native app once a bill payment journey is completed (i.e. payment is successful) via a CTA from the Setu webview. Please let our team know if you would like to enable this use case for your app.
</Callout>
<br />

<Callout type="warning">
 <b>Note:</b> For downloading and saving transaction receipts from the webview, the webview will need to handle a <code>onDownloadStartRequest</code> (or a similar function as per your webview plugin). Our sample below uses the <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_downloader">flutter_downloader</a> and <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/path_provider">path_provider</a> plugins for downloading and saving transaction receipts. Please follow the plugin specific documentation for implementation. Make sure you have added necessary permissions in your <code>AndroidManifest.xml</code> and <code>Info.plist</code> files for downloading and saving files.

##### Handle payment flow

The `initiatePayment` method in the `controller` takes an object param with the following fields

- `orderId` on the Setu COU System. It always starts with `COUWL`. Example— `COUWLZ7pFtTgr9LtO`
- `amount` to be paid by the customer. Example — `3522.20`
- `callback` URL which needs to be loaded in the webview once the payment is completed. Example —`https://billpay.setu.co/payment-callback/68c7217b-8fa7-4c1f-8e5f-317ff3027668`
- `beneVpa` to which amount is to be transferred—this is relevant only if you can transfer in real time using UPI rails.
- `remarks` used to communicate information between mobile app and webview
- `mobileNumber` mobile number used for the session. Example - `9876543210`
- `refId` BBPS reference ID linked to a particular bill (only available for fetch billers). Example - `CMA0I65RCU2I32C3L0H0KNYQYAG40021831`
- `customerId` linked to a particular session. Example - `cust@1234`
- `allowedPaymentModes` comma separated list of modes allowed for this payment. One of these should be sent in the `paymentMode` in the <a href="/payments/billpay/pre-built-screens/custom-payment/apis#webhook">payment confirmation webhook.</a>

When initiate_payment case is called by the webview, your app needs to do the following—

1. Remove the webview
2. Initiate the payment flow
3. Send Setu the webhook event for payment—this need not be done for UPI transfers in real time
4. Once payment is executed, load the webview again with the callback URL

<hr class="primary" />

#### Step 2 — Optionally configure webhook

You may optionally want to listen to user events—like successful or failed bill fetch, bill payment status and more—through webhooks. Refer to <a href="/payments/billpay/user-events" target="_blank">this guide</a> for more information.

<hr class="primary" />

#### Step 3 — Get Production credentials and go live

Once you are done testing your integration, ensure that all KYC and legal agreements are submitted. Contact Setu for getting enabled on production.
