## Agentic Bill Payments MCP Server

The Agentic Bill Payments MCP exposes a set of tools that let an AI agent help you discover bills, fetch amounts, pay bills, and track transactions using natural language. Check out our <a href="/payments/billpay/mcp/integration-guide" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">integration guide</a> on how to integrate this seamlessly.

You don't need to know which tool exists. Just ask naturally. If you're building or testing agents, the mapping below shows how prompts translate to tools.

## Tools

|-----------|------------------|---------------------|
| List Billers | Shows which billers are supported. | "Is my electricity provider supported?" |
| List Categories | Shows the types of bills you can pay. | "What kinds of bills can I pay here?" |
| Get Saved Bills | Shows the bills you've already paid for once. | "Do I have any pending bills?" |
| Fetch Bill | Fetches the latest amount due for a bill. | "How much is my Credit Card bill?" |
| Pay Bill | Initiates payment for a bill after confirmation. | "I want to recharge my FASTag account with Rs.500." |
| Check Payment Status | Checks whether a payment attempt was successful. | "Did my last payment go through?" |
| Get Transaction Receipt | Provides a receipt for a completed payment. | "Show me the receipt for my last payment." |
| List Payment History | Shows your past bill payments. | "Show all my bill payments from last 3 months." |

## Sample Prompts

You can use these prompts directly, and the Agent will know which tool to invoke. For the first time, you might have to allow the Agent to call the tool. These prompts automatically trigger multiple actions behind the scenes.

### Bill Payments

Use these to fetch bills, make payments, and track transaction status quickly and securely.

**Examples:**

- "Can I pay my electricity bill/broadband bill here?"
- "What kinds of bills can I pay here?"
- "Do I have any bills due?"
- "Pay my electricity bill."
- "I live in Chennai. I want to pay my electricity bill"
- "Did I pay my Credit Card bill this month? Share payment details"

You can also upload the image of your physical bill or screenshots of your bills from your payments app and watch the Agent fetch your outstanding bills!

### Analysis and Insights

Use these to understand why your bills look the way they do, and generate customised insights for you.

**Examples:**

- "Show me all the bills I usually pay."
- "Why was my electricity bill higher this summer?"
- "Summarise my bill payments from last month."
- "Show a breakdown of my bill spends by category."
- "Which bills do I spend the most on?"

### Proactive & Preventive Prompts

Use these to stay ahead of bills before they become urgent.

**Examples:**

- "Do I have any bills due in the next 7 days?"
- "Which bills usually come up around this time of the month?"

### Planning & Control Prompts

Use these to plan and budget.

**Examples:**

- "How much should I budget for bills every month?"
- "Which of my bills are fixed and which vary?"
