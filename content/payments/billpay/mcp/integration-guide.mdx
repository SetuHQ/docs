## Agentic Bill Payments - MCP Server - Integration guide

### ChatGPT

Ensure you have a ChatGPT Plus or a higher upgrade account.

     <li>On expanding it, you will see an option to enable Developer Mode.</li>
     <li>Once enabled, you will observe an orange highlight on your chat inputs.</li>
   </ol>

    <li>In the URL field, add <a href="https://billpay-mcp.setu.co/mcp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://billpay-mcp.setu.co/mcp</a>.</li>
     <li>Under Authentication, select OAuth; check the consent box, and confirm.</li>
   </ol>
3. **Verify your phone number with an OTP**
   <ol type="a">
     <li>On confirming, you will be taken to a page to enter your phone number and OTP. All bill payments require a phone number to fetch bills.</li>
   </ol>
4. **Start Chatting!**
   <ol type="a">
    <li>You can also instruct GPT to only use the <i>Setu Bill Payments MCP</i> on the chat window, by clicking on the plus icon and adding the MCP to your chat.</li>
     <li>It is not mandatory to do so, but could help in some scenarios.</li>
   </ol>

Claude / ChatGPT and other GUI clients will always implement that OAuth redirect to remote auth service implementations so Client ID or Secret is not to be used there.

### Using the MCP

ℹ️ To use any “tool”, a service of the MCP, the LLM client (ChatGPT or Claude) will ask you permission to allow to access that tool of the MCP. Please select “Always Allow” for a seamless experience. Currently, all LLM clients ask this permission for the first time each tool is used.
