## Pull Driving Licence via Digilocker

Use this flow to fetch a user's Driving Licence from Digilocker via Setu APIs. This involves two steps:

1. Redirect the user to complete the consent journey.
2. Fetch the Driving Licence document after consent is granted.

<hr class="primary" />

### 1. Redirect user to Digilocker

Initiate the consent flow by creating a Digilocker session. This will return a URL where the user can log in and share their Driving Licence.

### What happens during the consent journey?

The user will be redirected to Digilocker to:

- Verify their Aadhaar using OTP
- Enter their 6-digit security PIN
- Select documents (e.g. Driving Licence) to share
- Grant consent to share the document

Once completed, you can fetch the document using the request ID from Step 1.

## 2. Fetch the Driving Licence document

After the user grants consent, use the following API to fetch their Driving Licence.
