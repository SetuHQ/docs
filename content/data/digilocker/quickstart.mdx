## DigiLocker integration

Setu DigiLocker APIs can be used to fetch documents of your users instantly—with their consent.

Here’s a quick run through of the APIs—

-   **Create a DigiLocker request**—Create a request to start the user journey, with which you can get user consent and then fetch the document from user’s digilocker. You get an `id` in response, which you can use to track this request throughout the journey.
-   **Get DigiLocker request status**—Check status of a request that was created by passing the request `id`, at any point in the journey.
-   **Get list of all docs available**—Get a global list of all documents that DigiLocker lets you fetch and the identifiers required to fetch a particular document.
-   **Fetch a document**—Get the document that the user has consented to share with you, made available as a file URL to download. All docs other than Aadhaar, can be fetched with this API.
-   **Fetch Aadhaar data**—Fetch Aadhaar document data in JSON format as well as an XML file. The API response is consistent with our <a href="/data/okyc/overview" target="blank">OKYC APIs</a>, which aids in replacing OKYC with DigiLocker, for carrying out Aadhaar KYC.
-   **Revoke access token**—Revoke the OAuth user token, once necessary user documents are fetched.

Additionally, here are the URLs you would need for these APIs—

-   Sandbox—`https://dg-sandbox.setu.co`
-   Production—`https://dg.setu.co`
-   Headers—Contact Setu for providing the credentials required to successfully call Setu APIs. This contains:
    -   `x-client-id`
    -   `x-client-secret`

### Create a DigiLocker request

Call this API to create a new DigiLocker request. Pass the `redirectUrl` in the request body.

<Callout type="tip">
    A DigiLocker account is not mandatory for a user to start this flow. If the
    user does not have a DigiLocker account, DigiLocker will automatically
    create an account during the consent journey. User has to sign up by
    providing their Aadhaar number and authenticate with the OTP sent to Aadhaar
    registered mobile number.
</Callout>

<br />

<Callout type="warning">
    To sign up for DigiLocker, user should have linked their mobile number with
    Aadhaar.{" "}
</Callout>

    </Portion>

##### Usage of the redirect URL

You have to provide a `redirectUrl` in the request, which has to be a valid publicly hosted URL—the user gets redirected to this URL after going through DigiLocker Sign in / Sign up and consent screens.

It will also be used by Setu to send back relevant information about a request. By default Setu includes the `success` flag of the user consent and DigiLocker request `id`.

-   For a failed user consent, we will send back—`<redirectUrl>?success={false}&id={Digilocker_request.id}&errCode={code}&errMessage={message}`
-   For a successful signature—`<redirect_url>?success={true}&id={Digilocker_request.id}`

<Callout type="tip">
    You can also add custom query params such as <code>session id</code> from
    your end. You would append this to the provided URL, like so—
    <code>(redirectUrl)?sessionId=XYZ</code>
