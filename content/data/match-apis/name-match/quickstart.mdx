##  Name Match V1 API Quickstart

### Name Match overview

A Name Match API in KYC verification ensures accurate identity verification, detects errors and variations in names, and prevents identity fraud. 
It helps financial institutions comply with regulatory requirements like AML, enhances customer trust, and improves the efficiency and reliability of the verification process.

### What is Setu Name Match API?

The Setu Name Match API utilizes name-matching algorithms to accurately recognize variations of similar names from multiple sources. 
This allows organizations to make informed decisions on whether to accept or reject users during the onboarding process.

### How is Setu Name Match API designed?
The Setu Name Match API employs multiple backend algorithms to account for a wide range of name and identity variations commonly found in financial services. 
The API provides both optimistic and pessimistic match percentages for a given input, allowing organizations to choose the appropriate match based on their internal policies.

#### What is the difference between optimistic and pessimistic results?
We provide two results, an optimistic and pessimistic one, in order to allow the user to choose which result to use based on their risk policy. In the optimistic result, cases such as missing first/middle/last name, mis-spelt/out of order names are not penalised heavily. 
In the pessimistic output, these scenarios are penalised more heavily, leading to lower match percentages/types. However, it is not necessary for optimistic and pessimistic results to always be different, as highlighted in the examples below.

### Steps to integrate

#### 1 — Start KYC and business documentation

This is started once Setu’s Sales team has interacted with you and confirmed integration. You will need to add a few KYC details and review some agreements. Please reachout to us via <a href="https://setu.co/support" target="_blank">Setu Support</a> to get started here.

#### 2 — Get API credentials

Contact Setu to receive x-client-id, x-client-secret and x-product-instance-id details. These credentials are required to make API calls on Sandbox or Production.

#### 3 — Integrate on Sandbox

The URLs you would need for this API—

-   Sandbox—`https://dg-sandbox.setu.co`
-   Production—`https://dg.setu.co`
-   Headers—Contact Setu for providing the credentials required to successfully call Setu APIs. This contains:
    -   `x-client-id`
    -   `x-client-secret`
