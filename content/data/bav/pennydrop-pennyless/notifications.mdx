## Notifications

Below is the summary of the notifications which need to be processed on your server by exposing an endpoint for Setu to send an HTTP POST request. These notifications are sent by Setu when the Setu BAV request is completed

<Callout type="tip">
    Please send back an HTTP 2xx status code if the request sent was processed
    correctly to avoid receiving multiple notifications for the same event.
    Response body is ignored.
</Callout>
<br />

This will help you understand the notification flow before you start to implement it on your server.
