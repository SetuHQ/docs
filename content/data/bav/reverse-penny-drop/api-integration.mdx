# API Integration

Below is a quick summary of the APIs you need to start integrating with for bank verification using Reverse Penny Drop (RPD).

Here are the few things you would need for this integration—

-   Sandbox — `https://dg-sandbox.setu.co`
-   Production — `https://dg.setu.co`
-   Headers — `x-client-id`, `x-client-secret` and `x-product-instance-id`
-   Webhook endpoint: You need to create a [webhook url](#notifications---webhooks) on your server. Once configured, Setu will send notifications to that URL.

<Callout type="tip">
    To get started quickly, you can setup a mock API endpoint using{" "}
    <a href="https://beeceptor.com/" target="_blank">
        Beeceptor
    </a>
    . This will help you understand the notification flow before you start to
    implement it on your server.
</Callout>

#### Create reverse penny drop request

Send a `POST` request to the `/api/verify/ban/reverse` endpoint to create a reverse penny drop request.
Optionally you can pass `additionalData` with header `Content-Type` as `application/json`.

`additionalData` should be simple key-value pairs (string value only).
E.g:

<CodeBlockWithCopy language="json">
    {`
    "additionalData": {
        "key1": "value1",
        "key2": "value2"
    }
  `}
</CodeBlockWithCopy>

<Callout type="warning">
  You can expect this `additionalData` as part of a JSON body when we notify you
  with bank account verification details over webhook, or when you use our{" "}
  <code>GET</code> details API.
</Callout>
<br />

If successful, you will get a JSON response. Two of the fields in the response would be

-   `upiLink`, a UPI intent link starting with `upi://`
-   `shortUrl`, a link starting with `https://` and an image with a QR code

We recommend showing the QR code on desktop devices so that a user can use their phone to scan QR and pay. For mobile phones, it's recommended to use the UPI intent link to pay on the same device.

-   If you want PSP specific link. Read the <a target="_blank" href="/data/bav/reverse-penny-drop/quickstart#faqs">FAQ</a>.

<Callout type="tip">
    Notify your user, that they should pay from the account they want to use on
    your platform (if their primary account has to be verified for such usage).
</Callout>
<br />

<Callout type="warning">
    Once payment is done, the payment link expires, and cannot be reused again.
    The link can also expire if your customer hasn't paid in 24hrs—in this case
    you will be notified of the status of the request, which will be{" "}
    <b>BAV_REVERSE_PENNY_DROP_EXPIRED</b>.
</Callout>
<br />

<b>Types of statuses</b>

-   `BAV_REVERSE_PENNY_DROP_CREATED`, if request was created successfully.
-   `BAV_REVERSE_PENNY_DROP_FAILED`, something went wrong. A payment should not be attempted with this request id.
-   `BAV_REVERSE_PENNY_DROP_EXPIRED`, upon expiry of payment link for customer. No payments can be done with expired links. The expiry is triggered as per the specified `validUpto` field or within 24 hours, whichever comes first.
-   `BAV_REVERSE_PENNY_DROP_PAYMENT_SUCCESSFUL`, when your user has successfully paid, and Setu’s banking partner has sent a credit alert with bank account details.
-   `BAV_REVERSE_PENNY_DROP_PAYMENT_FAILED`, when an issue occurs during payment by your user or at Setu’s banking partner’s end. The payment, if made, will be auto-refunded.

<Callout type="warning">
    In some cases when our banking partner doesn't send us credit alerts the
    status still may show as <code>BAV_REVERSE_PENNY_DROP_CREATED</code>.
</Callout>

#### Mock payment

This API lets you test the end to end flow without an actual payment. This will send a webhook to the callback URL you have configured with us.

<Callout type="warning">
    Use this API only on sandbox/UAT. This endpoint is disabled on{" "}
    <b>production</b> environment.

#### Notifications / Webhooks

Below are the summary of the notifications which need to be processed on your server by exposing an endpoint for Setu to send an HTTP POST request with 5 exponential backoff retries

<Callout type="tip">
    Please send back HTTP 200 status code if the request sent was processed
    correctly to avoid receiving multiple notifications for the same payment
    event. Response body is ignored.
</Callout>

<br/>

Setu provides webhook authentication. For more details, refer to <a href="data/bav/reverse-penny-drop/webhook-authentication" target="_blank">webhook-authentication</a>


<hr className="tertiary" />

##### 1. RPD_VERIFICATION_UPDATE Webhook

This webhook is sent when the end user makes a payments.

_`accountType` can be `BANK_ACCOUNT`, `PPI` or `UNKNOWN`_

-   `PPI`, if the payment happened from a PPI (Pre Paid Instrument) account and not a valid bank account
-   `BANK_ACCOUNT`, if the payment happened from a valid bank account and the IFSC is in the RBI database
-   `UNKNOWN`, if the payment happened from a bank account who's IFSC is not in the RBI database

<Callout type="tip">
    If the bank account is classified as PPI, then it is for sure a PPI
    instrument and for majority of the use cases consider it an invalid bank
    account since money movement doesn't happen when trying to deposit an amount
    through IMPS/NEFT/RTGS. There can be PPI instruments which come up as
    `UNKNOWN`, please notify us at support@setu.co.
</Callout>


_`bankAccountType` is an optional data field, you may not receive the value always. (Please contact with Setu team to know more about this feature.)_
_The value can be `SAVINGS`, `CURRENT`, `NRO`, `NRE`_

#### Get Details API

This is an optional API. This API lets you know the bank verification status.

<Callout type="tip">
    Note: It should not be used for polling but only for specific use cases. For
    example: if you're not receiving successful webhook for a customer and want
    to know if the customer has made the INR 1 payment for bank verification or
    not.
</Callout>
<br />
<Callout type="warning">
  Note: Data will be purged after receiving a 2xx status code from the webhook. In the case of a non-2xx status code, the data will be purged after 24 hours.
</Callout>
