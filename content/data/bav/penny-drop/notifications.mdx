## Notifications

Below is the summary of the notifications which need to be processed on your server by exposing an endpoint for Setu to send an HTTP POST request.

These notifications are sent by Setu when the BAV Async Penny drop request is completed and we receive a response from our Banking partner regarding the status of the penny drop request.

<Callout type="tip">
    Please send back an HTTP 200 status code if the request sent was processed
    correctly to avoid receiving multiple notifications for the same async penny
    drop event. Response body is ignored.
</Callout>
<br />

The `base_url` is the server URL you share with us to receive notifications.

To get started quickly, you can setup a mock API endpoint using <a href="https://beeceptor.com/" target="_blank">Beeceptor</a>. Once configured, Setu will send notifications to that URL.

This will help you understand the notification flow before you start to implement it on your server.
