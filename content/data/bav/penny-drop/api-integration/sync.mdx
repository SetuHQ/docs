## Sync API

The following guide describes a sync API implementation for bank account verification. This lets you initiate a verification request and expect an immediate response on the status of the verification. Essentially, you will need the following API—

- **Verify bank account**—This lets you initiate a verification request, and get verification status in response.

Here are the URLs you would need for this integration—

- Sandbox—`https://dg-sandbox.setu.co`
- Production—`https://dg.setu.co`
- Headers—Contact Setu for providing the credentials required to successfully call Setu APIs. This contains:
  - `x-client-id`
  - `x-client-secret`

<Callout type="warning">
  While this is a simpler implementation, the experience for your end customer
  may be better handled with our{" "}
  <a href="/data/bav/api-integration/async">async APIs</a>, that let you
  asynchronously fetch the status associated with a bank verification request.{" "}
  <br />
  You can update the <code>pending</code> status on your UI , whenever the new status is available,
  rather than letting your customer wait for a response on the UI.

### Verify bank account

Call this API to verify bank account of your customer. A quick explanation of the request params—

- `ifsc` is the IFSC (Indian Financial System Code) of the bank branch, where the bank account is held.
- `accountNumber` is the bank account number that has to be verified.

While testing on Sandbox, you may use the following sample values—

- Use ABCD0123456 (IFSC) and 1234567890 (account number) to get a successful verification response.
- Use DCBA6543210 (IFSC) and 0987654321 (account number) to get a failed verification response.
