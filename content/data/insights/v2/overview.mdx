You feed this data into Setu Insights for analysis. Refer <a href="/data/account-aggregator/quickstart#quickstart-guide" target="_blank">AA docs</a> for a quick explanation of FIU, FIP, AA.

2.  **Analyse financial data**—The raw data goes through a categorization model of Setu Insights and gets bucketed into various categories of incomes, expenses etc.
