## Quickstart Guide

Here is a quick summary of steps to help you integrate with Setu’s Insights API. Before you start, there are some key terms that will be referred to periodically in the documentation—

- **FI Data block**—FI Data blocks are the data received from the FIP (Financial information provider), via the AA. Currently, we only support bank statement datablock.
- **Template**—A template is a pre-configured format that determines the structure of the generated report, including which insights to generate. You can pick and choose exactly what insights should be added to a template, based on your needs. For example, if you only want to generate income and expense insights of a customer, the template can contain only those two insights.

### Step 1—Template creation

You need to send in the below information to [insights@setu.co](mailto:insights@setu.co), for setting up your template.

|                           |                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **FIU ID**                | This can be obtained from your AA integration                                                                                                        |
| **Notification endpoint** | An endpoint where Setu will send you webhook notifications for events. See <a href="/data/insights/notifications" target="_blank">notifications</a>. |
| **Template name**         | Choose a suitable name, which helps you easily recognise this template                                                                               |
| **Insights required**     | A list of required Insights. See the full list <a href="/data/insights/insights" target="_blank">**here**</a>.                                       |
| **Output format**         | Format in which you need the output — currently only `JSON` is supported             
<br />

Setu will create a template for you and share a `templateID`, which can be used
in the API calls.

### Step 2—Feed data

Once you have the financial data of a user, you can feed this data into Setu Insights as a FI Data block. A `dataId` is assigned to to every FI Data block that is created. Refer <a href="/data/insights/quickstart/api-integration" target="_blank">API integration</a> to integrate with Data ingestion APIs.

<hr className="primary" />

### Step 3—Generate insights

You can generate insights for each FI Data block that is created in the previous step. To generate insights, pass the `templateId` and `dataId` from the previous steps.

An insight report is idenitified by a `reportId` and will be sent to you asynchronously on the notification URL you provide. You can also fetch a generated insight with the `reportId` at any point. Refer <a href="/data/insights/quickstart/api-integration" target="_blank">API integration</a> to integrate with Insight generation APIs.

## Test on Postman or integrate APIs

If you are getting started with the integration, we recommend that you familiarise yourself with setting up Postman and configuring **credentials**. If you have already completed this step, you can integrate with the Setu Insights APIs directly.
