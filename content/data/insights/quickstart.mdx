## Quickstart Guide

Here is a quick summary of steps to help you integrate with Setu’s Insights API. Before you start, there are some key terms that will be referred to periodically in the documentation—

-   **FI Datablock**— FI Datablocks are the data received from the FIP (Financial Information Provider), via the AA. Currently, we only support bank statement data.
-   **Template**— A template is a pre-configured format, that outlines the structure and organization of the generated report, including which insights to generate. You can pick and choose exactly what modules should be added to a template based on your needs. For example, if you only want to generate the income and expense insights of a customer, the template can contain only those two modules.

### Step 1 - Template creation

FIU needs to send in the below information to be configured to [insights@setu.co](mailto:insights@setu.co)

-   **FIU ID** received from the integration with AA
-   **Name** for the template, and a list of required <a href="/data/insights/postman" target="_blank">**Insights**</a>
-   **Format** of the template's output (currently defaults to `JSON`)

Setu will create a template on your behalf and share a `Template ID`, which can be used when [generating insights](#step-3-generate-insights)

<br />

### Step 2 - AA Gateway integration

##### Create FI-Datablocks

Create an FI Datablock in Setu's Insights module by making a POST call to `/v1/fi_data` with the data fetched from the AA

-   The payload should be the same data fetched from the FIP. The schema of this data is validated against the [ReBIT schema](https://api.rebit.org.in/schema)
-   The API returns a `Data ID` for the datablock along with some metadata, which can be used when [generating insights](#step-3-generate-insights)
-   A list of available data blocks can also be obtained by making a GET call to `/v1/fi_data`

<br />

### Step 3 - Generate Insights

-   Generate Insights by making an API call to `/v1/insight`, with the template ID, and a list of data IDs in the payload
-   The API will post an asynchronous job and return a Report ID, which can later be used to obtain the insights generated
-   Setu will post a <a href="/data/insights/quickstart/notifications" target="_blank">notification</a> to the **notification endpoint** <a href="/data/account-aggregator/quickstart#integrating-fiu-apis-on-sandbox" target="_blank">configured for the FIU app</a>, along with the generated insights

## Test on Postman or integrate APIs

If you are getting started with the integration, we recommend that you familiarise yourself with setting up Postman and configuring **credentials**. If you have already completed this step, you can integrate with the Setu Insights APIs directly.
