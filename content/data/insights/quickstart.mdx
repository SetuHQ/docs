## Quickstart Guide

Here is a quick summary of steps to help you integrate with Setu’s Insights API. Before you start, there are some key terms that will be referred to periodically in the documentation—

- **Reference Id**—Developers can define an identifier to manage and track one customer's data points. This `refId` groups together all data for a single analysis session and is used throughout the lifecycle to push data and generate insights.
- **FI Data block**—FI Data blocks are the data received from the FIP (Financial information provider), via the AA. Currently, we support bank statement, equities, mutual_fund and etf datablocks. In addition, we support ePDF-based bank statements for Indian banks.
- **Template**—A template is a pre-configured format that determines the structure of the generated report, including which insights to generate. You can pick and choose exactly what insights should be added to a template, based on your needs.  
For example, if you only want to generate income and expense insights of a customer, the template can contain only those two insights.

### Step 1—Template creation

You need to send in the below information to [insights@setu.co](mailto:insights@setu.co), for setting up your template.

Send the following details to [insights@setu.co](mailto:insights@setu.co) —

Setu will create a template for you and share a `templateID`, which can be used
in the API calls.

### Step 2—Feed data

Once you have the user’s financial data, you can push it to Setu Insights. Use a single `refId` for each customer to group all their data for an analysis session. You can call the endpoint multiple times with the same `refId` to upload data for different accounts.

- **AA-sourced JSON** – Use `POST /v3/fiData`. The request body can contain data for a single account or an array of accounts.
- **Bank PDF statements** – Use `/v3/pdf-ingest` for PDF uploads

Use a single `refId` per customer. See the <a href="/data/insights/quickstart/api-integration">API Integration</a> section for details.

### Step 3—Generate insights

You can generate insights for each customer using the `refId` from the data ingestion step. This is a two-step process:

An insight report is idenitified by a `reportId` and will be sent to you asynchronously on the notification URL you provide. You can also fetch a generated insight with the `reportId` at any point.

## Test on Postman or integrate APIs

If you are getting started with the integration, we recommend that you familiarise yourself with setting up Postman and configuring **credentials**. If you have already completed this step, you can integrate with the Setu Insights APIs directly.
