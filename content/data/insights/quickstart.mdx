## Quickstart Guide

Here is a quick summary of steps to help you integrate with Setu’s Insights API. Before you start, there are some key terms that will be referred to periodically in the documentation—

- **Reference Id**—Developers can define an identifier to manage and track one customer's data points. This `refId` groups together all data for a single analysis session and is used throughout the lifecycle to push data and generate insights.
- **FI Data block**—FI Data blocks are the data received from the FIP (Financial information provider), via the AA. Currently, we support bank statement, equities, mutual_fund and etf datablocks. In addition, we support ePDF-based bank statements for Indian banks.
- **Template**—A template is a pre-configured format that determines the structure of the generated report, including which insights to generate. You can pick and choose exactly what insights should be added to a template, based on your needs.  
For example, if you only want to generate income and expense insights of a customer, the template can contain only those two insights.

### Step 1—Create a template

You can create a template either by contacting Setu, or directly via API.

#### Option 1: Email template details

Send the following details to [insights@setu.co](mailto:insights@setu.co) —

| Field                  | Description                                                                                                                                  |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **FIU ID**             | Obtained from your AA integration                                                                                                            |
| **Notification endpoint** | An endpoint where Setu will send you webhook notifications for events. See <a href="/data/insights/notifications" target="_blank">notifications</a>.                                         |
| **Template name**      | Choose a suitable name, which helps you easily recognise this template                                                                                                            |
| **Use case**           | Sharing your use case will help us guide you with finalizing relevant insights. Typical use cases, Loan Underwriting, F&O, Portfolio Management, Personal Finance Management, etc.                                       |
| **Insights required**  |  A list of required Insights. Send an email to [insights@setu.co](mailto:insights@setu.co) for full list of insights.                                               |
| **Output format**      | Format in which you need the output — currently we support `JSON`, and `XLSX`.                                                                                                                |

#### Option 2: Use API to create a template

You can create templates via API using `POST /v3/template`. See <a href="/data/insights/quickstart/api-integration">API Integration</a> for details.

Setu will respond with a `templateId`, which is required to generate insight reports.

<hr className="primary" />

### Step 2—Ingest data

Once you have the user’s financial data, you can push it to Setu Insights. Use a single `refId` for each customer to group all their data for an analysis session. You can call the endpoint multiple times with the same `refId` to upload data for different accounts.

- **AA-sourced JSON** – Use `POST /v3/fiData`. The request body can contain data for a single account or an array of accounts.
- **Bank PDF statements** – Use `/v3/pdf-ingest` for PDF uploads

Use a single `refId` per customer. See the <a href="/data/insights/quickstart/api-integration">API Integration</a> section for details.

<hr className="primary" />

### Step 3—Generate and retrieve insights

You can generate insights for each customer using the `refId` from the data ingestion step. This is a two-step process:

First, you trigger an asynchronous job to generate insights by calling `POST /v3/insight` with a `refId` and a `templateId`. A successful request queues the job and returns a `reportId`.

Then, you retrieve the results. The generated insights can be sent to your webhook URL, or you can poll the `GET /v3/insight?reportId={reportId}` endpoint to get the report.

### Step 4 — (Optional) Purge Customer Data

You can delete a customer’s data from Setu using the `refId` via the `/v3/purge` API. This is useful for meeting data minimization and regulatory compliance requirements such as user data deletion requests under privacy laws.

When a purge is triggered:

- **All Financial Information (FI) data** retrieved for the user is permanently deleted.
- **All insights** generated from this FI data—such as income summaries, categorized transactions, and financial behavior indicators—are also removed.

See the <a href="/data/insights/quickstart/api-integration">API Integration</a> section for more details on how to use this endpoint.
