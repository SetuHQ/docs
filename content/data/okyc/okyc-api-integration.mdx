## OKYC API integration

Setu’s API solution can be used to complete a customer’s KYC with offline Aadhaar in real-time—with your own screens on your app or website. With this, you will get a downloadable, locked XML file with Aadhaar information from your customers.

The following APIs are required for enabling this flow—

- **Create OKYC request**—Create OKYC request for your customer. You will get a unique `id` in the response which can be used to track this particular request.
- **Initiate OKYC Request**—Initialise the OKYC request for your customer with the previously returned request `id` and receive a `base64` encoded `captchaImage` from Setu. Once you have called this API, you can redirect your customer to your OKYC screens, to collect Aadhaar number and captcha from your customer.
- **Verify OKYC Request**—Share the `aadhaarNumber` and `captchaCode`, collected from your customer, with Setu. Next, redirect your customer to a screen to collect OTP sent to your customer’s Aadhaar linked mobile number. Also request your customer to enter a 4 digit share code—this is the code that will be used to unlock you customer’s fetch Aadhaar XML file.
- **Complete OKYC Request**—Share the collected `otp` and `shareCode` to complete verification process. Next, you can call the **Get OKYC request status** API. Once the OKYC request has been processed successfully you will get customer details from the Aadhaar and the XML file link in the response.
- **Get OKYC request status**—Get status of customer verification by providing the request `id` and optionally, the `shareCode`.

Additionally, here is the information you would need for calling these APIs—

- Sandbox URL—`https://dg-sandbox.setu.co`
- Production URL—`https://dg.setu.co`
- Headers—Contact Setu for providing the credentials required to successfully call Setu APIs. This contains:
  - `x-client-id`
  - `x-client-secret`
  - `x-product-instance-id`

### Verify OKYC request

Call this API once you have collected the following details from your customer—

- `aadhaarNumber` —This is not saved/stored by Setu, but is passed on to UIDAI to initiate sending an OTP to your customer’s Aadhaar linked mobile number.
- `captchaCode`—An encoded captcha image is provided to you by Setu, as received from UIDAI, in the **_Initiate OKYC request_** API response. You would need to convert this to an image and display it to your customer, wherein they would enter the text associated with the captcha. A correct captcha response is expected to proceed to the next API call.

<Callout type="tip">
  For testing this API on Sandbox, use 999999990019 as the Aadhaar number for
  success. Any other value for Aadhaar will be considered invalid. Use 2GAD0 for
  valid captcha and any other value for invalid.

### Complete OKYC request

Call this API once you have collected the following details from your customer—

- `otp` —This should be filled in by the customer, who would have received an OTP from UIDAI, on their Aadhaar linked mobile number.
- `shareCode` is a 4 digit pin set by the customer and serves as the password to unlock the contents of the XML file at a later stage.
- `aadhaarNumber` —This is not saved/stored by Setu, but is passed on to UIDAI to verify OTP.

<Callout type="tip">
  Before calling the API, you may want to save the <code>shareCode</code> on
  your end, as Setu will not store it and will simply pass on the value you
  provide to UIDAI.
</Callout>

<hr class="tertiary" />

This API returns the unwrapped Aadhaar response, as well as a link to the XML, if the `otp` is correct. If `otp` is incorrect, the OKYC `status` remains `incomplete`. To test for different scenarios, use the following `otp` values on Sandbox—

- Use 123456 for a valid OTP.
- Use 123457 for OTP to mimic 1st failed attempt.
- Use 123458 for OTP to mimic 2nd failed attempt.
- Use 123459 for OTP to mimic failed attempts limit exceeded.
- Anything aside from these values returns an error description as a generic “error”, if the upstream service returns an error.

You may use any 4 digit value for the `shareCode`, when testing on Sandbox.

### Get OKYC request status

Call this API to view status of an OKYC journey that you initiated with a customer.

When the `status` of the OKYC request `id` is `complete`, this API returns—

- Aadhaar details in json, if a correct `shareCode` is passed.
- An error, if an incorrect `shareCode` is passed.
- A link to the zip/xml aadhaar details, if no `shareCode` is passed.

<Callout type="warning">
  If the request <code>status</code> is <code>incomplete</code>, call the{" "}
  <strong>Complete OKYC request</strong> API with a correct <code>otp</code>{" "}
  input to mark request <code>status</code> as <code>complete</code>.
</Callout>

<br />

<Callout type="tip">
  You can call this API whenever you need to check for the <code>status</code>{" "}
  associated with a particular request <code>id</code>.
</Callout>

<br />

Possible values for `status`, received as part of the response—

- When `complete`, KYC is complete for a customer. If you provide a `shareCode` in the API request, you will get all customer details from the Aadhaar XML file.
- When `incomplete`, you can check for KYC completion after some time.
- In case the request has `expired`, your will get a `404` error code.
