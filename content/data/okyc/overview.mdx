## Offline Aadhaar KYC

### What is offline Aadhaar KYC?

Offline Aadhaar KYC, or OKYC, is a legally compliant KYC method as per UIDAI guidelines. Your customers can provide their Aadhaar number and verify with an OTP sent to their Aadhaar-linked mobile number, to access a downloadable XML file with their Aadhaar details.

This file has all details that can be derived from an Aadhaar card—like name, gender, DOB, address—and is locked by default. Your customer sets up a 4-digit access code that can be used to unlock the contents of this file.
