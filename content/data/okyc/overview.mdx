## Offline Aadhaar KYC

### What is offline Aadhaar KYC?

Offline Aadhaar KYC, or OKYC, is a legally compliant KYC method as per UIDAI guidelines. Your customers can provide their Aadhaar number and verify with an OTP sent to their Aadhaar-linked mobile number, to access a downloadable XML file with their Aadhaar details.

This file has all details that can be derived from an Aadhaar cardâ€”like name, gender, DOB, addressâ€”and is locked by default. Your customer sets up a 4-digit access code that can be used to unlock the contents of this file.
