## Offline Aadhaar KYC integration

Setu’s web based solution can be used to complete a customer’s KYC with offline Aadhaar—within your own app or website, in real-time. Offline Aadhaar involves getting a downloadable, locked XML file with Aadhaar information from your customers.

Essentially, only 2 APIs are required for enabling this flow—

- **Create OKYC request**—Create OKYC request for your customer. You will get a unique `id` in the response which can be used to track this particular request.
  - Post this, the customer should be redirected to Setu’s UI for collection of details like Aadhaar number and share code for the locked XML file.
- **Get OKYC request status**—Get status of customer verification by providing the request `id`.

Additionally, here are the URLs you would need for these APIs—

- Sandbox—`https://dg-sandbox.setu.co`
- Production—`https://dg.setu.co`
- Headers—Contact Setu for providing the credentials required to successfully call Setu APIs. This contains:
  - `x-client-id`
  - `x-client-secret`
  - `x-product-instance-id`

### Create OKYC request

Call this API to create a unique request to get your customer started on the OKYC journey.

Setu’s pre-built screens will handle the OKYC completion flow, but you need to give Setu a `redirectURL`—this is where we will redirect your customer, once the OKYC journey is complete. This is the only param needed to create a new OKYC request.

### Completion of OKYC by customer

<p>
  <Badge type="tip">SETU SCREENS</Badge> are used to collect OKYC details from
  your customer. The following details are collected, as shown in the sample
  screen flow below—
</p>

- **Aadhaar number** —not saved/stored by Setu—which is used to fetch the corresponding XML file for the customer, _after_ an OTP verification is done with Aadhaar linked mobile number.
- **Share code** is a 4 digit pin set by the customer and serves as the password to unlock the contents of the XML file.

    <Callout type="tip">
      When OKYC is completed, Setu will redirect the customer to the{" "}
      <code>redirectURL</code> that you provided in the Create OKYC request API.
      Setu will append the <b>share code</b> provided by the customer, and the
      request <code>id</code> to the provided URL. You should store both these
      values on your system to access the XML file at a later stage.

### Get OKYC request status

Call this API to view status of an OKYC journey that you initiated with a customer.

<Callout type="tip">
  You can call this API whenever you need to check for the <code>status</code>{" "}
  associated with a particular request <code>id</code>.
</Callout>

<br />

Possible values for `status`, received as part of the response—

- When `complete`, KYC is complete for a customer. If you provide a `shareCode` in the API request, you will get all customer details from the Aadhaar XML file.
- When `incomplete`, you can check for KYC completion after some time.
- In case the request has `expired`, your will get a `404` error code.
