## Quickstart Guide

Here is a quick summary of steps to help you integrate with Setu’s AA. Before you start, there are some key terms that will be referred to periodically in the documentation—

- **AA** or Account Aggregator—An entity licensed to show financial data requests to a customer and manage consent approvals/rejections. Setu partners with licensed AAs and offers pre-built, themeable screens to present data requests to your customers.
- **FI**—Financial information, the financial data of a user that is being requested for.
- **FIU** or Financial Information User—The entity requesting for data from its customers, i.e., you.
- **FIP** or Financial Information Provider—The entity that you request the financial data from, like a bank or an insurance provider.
- **FI types / data sources**—The types of financial data you can request for, from your customers. Setu AA provides mock data for all 23 FI data types enabled by AA. You can check them out <a href="/data/account-aggregator/fi-data-types" target="_blank">here</a>.
- **Consent object/request**—This is core of the AA framework, wherein you (the FIU) request for consent from your customer to use one or more FI types. As part of the consent object, you would need to provide details like the reason for data request, how many times the data would be fetched etc. You can read more on the details that are sent as part of consent request <a href="/data/account-aggregator/consent-object" target="_blank">here</a>.

### Integrating FIU APIs on Sandbox

##### Create an FIU config on the Bridge

Register on <a href="https://bridge.setu.co/" target="_blank">The Bridge</a>, if you haven’t already. From the **Products** page, navigate to the **Data** tab. Select the Financial Information User to begin creating the FIU.

You can read a bit about the FIU product on the profile page before clicking on the **Create an FIU** button.

<hr class="primary" />

###### Step 1 — Add an FIU app name

Enter a name for the FIU app. This is what the FIU will be registered as eventually, but you can always edit before going live.

<hr class="primary" />

###### Step 2 — Theme Consent Manager screens

Setu provides a set of prebuilt screens that your customer sees upon receiving the consent request from you. These screens will be used by your customer to register with Setu AA, review consent request, link their data and approve/reject the request.

You can theme these screens to match your brand—add your logo, primary and secondary colours, font colour and background colour—to provide a seamless UI transition for your customers.

<hr class="primary" />

###### Step 3 — Provide endpoint for FIU to send notifications

You will need to specify a **notification endpoint** on The Bridge, the URL to which Setu will send notifications.

<Callout type="tip">
  To get started quickly, you can setup a mock API endpoint using{" "}
  <a href="https://beeceptor.com/" target="_blank">
    Beeceptor
  </a>
  . Once configured on Bridge, Setu will send notifications to that URL. This will
  help you understand the notification flow before you start to implement it on your
  server.
</Callout>

<br />

You will be notified for two types of events—

- Actions by the user, such as accepting or rejecting a consent request, and
- Updates from the FIP, such as when the requested data is ready to be fetched.

You can read about notifications in detail <a href="/data/account-aggregator/api-integration/notifications" target="_blank">here</a>.

<hr class="primary" />

###### Step 4 — Get credentials

Once all the above steps are complete, you can grab your sandbox credentials, `client_id` and `client_secret`. You're now ready to integrate FIU APIs and make API calls using Postman on sandbox.

<hr class="primary" />

### Moving to Production

##### Configuration

FIU needs to provide Setu with the following items for configuration

- **Notification endpoint for webhooks**
- **UI color scheme**
- **Logo URL**

Please send these details via email to [aa@setu.co](mailto:aa@setu.co)

##### Setup

Setu will start the infrastructure setup for the FIU. We will deploy the FIU service based on your configuration on Setu's AWS with a sub-domain. This process can take upto 2-4 hours.

Once the infrastructure setup is done, Setu will reach out to the FIU with relevant details, `FIU ID`, `client_id` and `client_secret`.

##### Ready to go!

Once you receive these details from Setu, you can now access consented sharing of your users' financial data

## Test on Postman or integrate APIs

If you are just starting integration, we recommend that you familiarise yourself with all FIU APIs through Postman. If you have already finished this, you can integrate with FIU APIs directly.
