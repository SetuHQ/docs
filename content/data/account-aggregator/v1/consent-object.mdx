## The consent object

The consent `Detail` object is the core of the AA framework. When an FIU requires data about the user, the request is packaged in the form of a consent object.

This consent object carries information about all the different types of data the FIU needs, the purpose of the data, and how the FIU plans to use the data and so on. All params described below are required, except for `DataFilter`.
