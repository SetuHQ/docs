## The consent object

The consent `Detail` object is the core of the AA framework. When an FIU requires data about the user, the request is packaged in the form of a consent object.

This consent object carries information about all the different types of data the FIU needs, the purpose of the data, and how the FIU plans to use the data and so on. All params described below are required, except for `DataFilter`.

It is mandatory only when the `consentTypes` array includes `TRANSACTIONS`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `DataLife`                                      | This is the time period for which you are allowed to store the data. Choose between `MONTH`, `YEAR`, `DAY`, `INF` as the `unit` and define a numeric `value` alongside.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `Frequency` has 2 components—`unit` and `value` | `unit` can be `HOURLY`, `DAILY`, `MONTHLY`, `YEARLY`. `value` has to be greater than 0.<br/>Additionally the maximum frequency value is defined is `1` request per HOUR. So, no more than `24` requests are allowed per DAY                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `DataFilter`                                    | Allows you to specify conditions for filtering the data being fetched. For example, fetch transactions where the `TRANSACTIONAMOUNT` is greater than or equal to INR 20,000. You can use the `type`, `operator` and `value` keys to set the filters.                                                                                                                                                         |
| `redirectUrl`                                   | Redirect your users back to your application once the consent is reviewed. By default, the redirectURL is https://setu.co/                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `context`                                   | Allows you to specify an FIP OR Account type (Current, Savings, Insurance, etc) as a key value pair for you to be able to customise the accounts fetched on the consent flow. We support the context filters `accounttype` which takes the Key as `accounttype`  where values can be `CURRENT` or `SAVINGS` and  `fipid` with the `FIP ID` as the value(s).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
