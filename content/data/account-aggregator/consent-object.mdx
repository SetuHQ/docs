## The consent object

The consent `Detail` object is the core of the AA framework. When an FIU requires data about the user, the request is packaged in the form of a consent object.

This consent object carries information about all the different types of data the FIU needs, the purpose of the data, and how the FIU plans to use the data and so on. All params described below are required, except for `DataFilter`.

Future dates, typically correspond to `PERIODIC` fetches, while a `from` and `to` date-time in the past corresponds to ONETIME fetches.                                       |Only when `consentTypes` array includes `TRANSACTIONS`

| `Frequency` has 2 components—`unit` and `value` | `unit` can be `HOURLY`, `DAILY`, `MONTHLY`, `YEARLY`. `value` has to be greater than 0.<br/>Additionally the maximum frequency value is defined is `1` request per HOUR. So, no more than `24` requests are allowed per DAY                                                                                                                                                                                                          |Yes
| `DataFilter`                                    | Allows you to specify conditions for filtering the data being fetched.

You can use the `type`, `operator` and `value` keys to set the filters.                                                                                                                                                                                 |No

| `context`                                   | Allows you to specify an FIP OR Account type (Current, Savings, Insurance, etc) as a key value pair for you to be able to customise the accounts fetched on the consent flow. We support the context filters `accounttype` which takes the Key as `accounttype`  where values can be `CURRENT` or `SAVINGS` and  `fipid` with the `FIP ID` as the value(s).                                                                              |No                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
