## Consent object

The consent object is the core of the AA framework. When an FIU requires data about the user, the request is packaged in the form of a consent object.

Consent object contains the information about all the different types of data the FIU needs, the purpose of the data, and how the FIU plans to use the data and so on.

<Callout type type="warning">
  As specified in the table below, some parameters have to be passed mandatorily
  when creating a consent.
</Callout>

<br />

### Consent template

If some parameters of the consent object do not change for each consent, you
can take advantage of our <b>consent template</b> and provide a default value
for such parameters and omit them in the API payload, during consent creation.
However, if you do pass a value in the payload, it will override the default
value provided in the template.

<Callout type type="tip">
  You can set up the consent template on{" "}
  <a href="https://bridge.setu.co/v2/login" target="_blank">
    Bridge
  </a>
  , in Step 1 of product configuration. Only select parameters can be set up using
  consent template—refer to the last column in the table below.

<br />
<Callout type type="warning">
  If a mandatory parameter is not specified in the template, then it has to be
  compulsorily provided during consent creation in the API payload.

### Consent request object

| Property name                                                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Mandatory?                                                     | Supported by consent template? |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `consentDuration` has 2 components—`unit` and `value`         | This defines the time period for which the consent is valid and can be used to fetch data. The start timestamp is assumed to be the timestamp at which the consent is created and the end timestamp is calculated based on the `consentDuration` provided. `unit` can be `MONTH`, `YEAR`, `DAY`.                                                                                                             | Yes, but can be skipped if `consentDateRange` is specified     | No                             |
| `consentDateRange` has 2 components-`startDate` and `endDate` | These timestamps define the time period for which the consent is valid and can be used to fetch data. Provides the same functionality as `consentDuration`, hence use only one of these. If both `consentDuration` and `consentDateRange` are passed, then `consentDuration` takes precedence.                                                                                                               | Yes, but can be skipped if `consentDuration` is specified      | No                             |
