## Consent object

The consent object is the core of the AA framework. When an FIU requires data about the user, the request is packaged in the form of a consent object.

Consent object contains the information about all the different types of data the FIU needs, the purpose of the data, and how the FIU plans to use the data and so on.

<Callout type="tip">
  Tagging helps you organize and track consent requests, reports, and analytics
  more effectively. With this feature, you can add relevant labels (tags) to
  different consent requests and data-fetch reports without creating separate
  product instances. Tags make it easier to segment, analyze, and track data for
  different use cases, such as monitoring traffic for specific partners or
  campaigns.

  Tag functionality is currently available through APIs only. Support for Bridge UI will be added soon.

### Consent request object

| Property name                                                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Mandatory?                                                 |

| `consentDuration` has 2 components—`unit` and `value`         | This defines the time period for which the consent is valid and can be used to fetch data. The start timestamp is assumed to be the timestamp at which the consent is created and the end timestamp is calculated based on the `consentDuration` provided. `unit` can be `MONTH`, `YEAR`, `DAY`.                                                                                                             | Yes, but can be skipped if `consentDateRange` is specified |
| `consentDateRange` has 2 components-`startDate` and `endDate` | These timestamps define the time period for which the consent is valid and can be used to fetch data. Provides the same functionality as `consentDuration`, hence use only one of these. If both `consentDuration` and `consentDateRange` are passed, then `consentDuration` takes precedence.                                                                                                               | Yes, but can be skipped if `consentDuration` is specified  |

| `id`          | Unique consent reference Id generated by Setu. Use this to poll consent status or initiate data session requests.                                          |
| `url`         | Redirect your users to Setu AA screens to initiate consent review flow using this url                                                                      |

| `Usage`       | This field specifies `lastUsed` and `count` which corresponds to data fetches against the consent id. It is also available in Get Consent Status response. |

### Understanding Tags in AA Framework

• Tags must first be created at the product instance level before they can be used in any requests.

• Tags can be created and managed while setting up or updating a product instance. They are unique identifiers (max 100 characters) that can be linked to multiple product instances.

• Tags are visible in consent and data-fetch reports, and serve as filters in analytics dashboards. Use them to track user journeys, monitor failures, analyze behavior, measure campaign performance, and generate custom insights.

• Key limitations and rules:

- Tags are case-sensitive (e.g., "partnerA" and "PartnerA" will be considered two different tags)
- Duplicate tags are not allowed
- Bulk tagging for historical data is not supported
- Number of tags per FIU is configurable
- Invalid characters will trigger errors
- System issues may prevent tag application (with error notifications)

• Best practice: Use clear, consistent, and easily understandable tag names for effective tracking.

• To add tags to a consent request, include them under the `additionalParams` field:

<CodeBlockWithCopy language="json">
  {`{
  "consentDetail": {
    ...
  },
  ...,
  "additionalParams": {
    "tags": ["Loan_Tracking", "Partner_X"]
  }
}`}

## FIP Selector Screen

<Callout type="info">
  This feature is coming soon and will be available in future releases.
</Callout>

### Overview

The FIP Selector Screen is a feature that helps improve AA journey success rates by intelligently routing users to the best performing Account Aggregator (AA) - FIP pair.

It enables FIUs to:

- Select the best-performing AA for a given FIP (instead of just the highest overall-performing AA).
- Provide explicit user consent for using PII (mobile number) to discover pre-existing handles on AAs.
- Reduce drop-offs on the account linking page by routing users to an AA where they already have a handle.
- Move away from latency-prone autodiscovery flows by adopting a faster, targeted manual discovery approach.

All of this enables better consent conversion across the funnel

### How it works

1. User lands on the FIP Selector Screen before the AA journey
2. FIU (or Setu module) shows available FIPs and takes explicit user consent to use PII data via a checkbox.
3. Setu uses this consent to:
   - Discover pre-existing AA handles (using mobile number).
   - Route requests to the best-performing AA for that specific FIP.
4. The improved routing logic kicks in, reducing drop-offs and boosting success rates.

The FIP Selector Screen flow works as follows:

1. **User selects FIP** → User chooses their preferred Financial Information Provider
2. **Consent checkbox for discovery** → User provides explicit consent for PII usage
3. **Setu checks AA handles using mobile number** → System discovers pre-existing handles
4. **Best performing AA for FIP** → Intelligent routing based on performance data
5. **Consent creation via AA** → Consent is created through the optimal AA
6. **Account linking + Data fetch** → Final step of account connection and data retrieval

### How FIUs can enable this

#### ✅ Case 1: FIUs with an existing FIP Selector Screen

1. Add the consent checkbox to your FIP Selector Screen.
2. Share a screenshot of the updated screen with Setu.
3. For Finvu, also complete the AA Profile Discovery API Access Request form.
4. For OneMoney and Anumati, Setu will share your screenshot with the AA for approval.
5. Once confirmed, this data will be used in the AA routing logic.

**Example consent box text:** *[Add whatever we are using in the FE screen as a sample]*

#### ✅ Case 2: FIUs without an FIP Selector Screen

1. Setu will provide an opt-in module for the FIP Selector Screen.
2. No need to share screenshots - Setu will handle UI, routing, and compliance requirements end-to-end.
3. Setu will also assist with form submissions for AA sign-offs

### Tech implementation

#### Case 1: FIUs NOT passing Account Aggregator the context filter (Multi AA)

**Create Consent API Changes**

Request Payload:
```json
{
  "vua": "9999999999"  // Only mobile number (no AA suffix)
}
```

Response Payload:
```json
{
  "vua": "9999999999",     // Only mobile number
  "status": "INITIATED",   // Initial status (PENDING status sent via notification once actual consent is created with AA)
  // ...other fields remain unchanged
}
```

**Key Changes:**
- Initial status is `INITIATED` instead of `PENDING`
- VUA contains only mobile number without AA suffix
- Actual `PENDING` status communicated via notification after consent creation

**Notification Handler Updates**

Once the user completes the bank selection, we'll create consent on the most optimal Account Aggregator (AA) for the selected Financial Information Provider (FIP) and then send the PENDING status.

Success Notification Payload:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "status": "PENDING",                    // New additional status
    "vua": "9999999999@selectedAA"        // Updated with selected AA
  },
  "success": true,
  "type": "CONSENT_STATUS_UPDATE", 
  "error": null,
  "consentId": "<<consentId>>",
  "notificationId": "<<notificationId>>",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-29T07:28:24.547Z"
}
```

Failure Notification Payload:
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "ConsentObjectCreationFailure", 
    "message": "Internal server error occurred while fetching consent details from upstream AA"
  },
  "data": null,
  "consentId": "<<consentId>>",
  "notificationId": "<<notificationId>>",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-29T07:28:24.547Z",
  "type": "CONSENT_STATUS_UPDATE"
}
```

**Required Implementation:**
- Add `CONSENT_STATUS_UPDATE` notification handler
- Update status management logic
- Handle VUA format changes

#### Case 2: FIUs passing specific AA in the context filter

✅ **No changes required from FIUs for Case 2**

This case works immediately with existing implementations as it's purely an optimization that doesn't affect consent status transitions.
