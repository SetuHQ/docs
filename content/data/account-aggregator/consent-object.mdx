## Consent object

The consent object is the core of the AA framework. When an FIU requires data about the user, the request is packaged in the form of a consent object.

Consent object contains the information about all the different types of data the FIU needs, the purpose of the data, and how the FIU plans to use the data and so on.

<Callout type="warning">
  As specified in the table below, some parameters have to be passed mandatorily
  when creating a consent.

<Callout type="tip">
  Tagging helps you organize and track consent requests, reports, and analytics
  more effectively. With this feature, you can add relevant labels (tags) to
  different consent requests and data-fetch reports without creating separate
  product instances. Tags make it easier to segment, analyze, and track data for
  different use cases, such as monitoring traffic for specific partners or
  campaigns.

### Consent request object

| Property name                                                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Mandatory?                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `consentDuration` has 2 components—`unit` and `value`         | This defines the time period for which the consent is valid and can be used to fetch data. The start timestamp is assumed to be the timestamp at which the consent is created and the end timestamp is calculated based on the `consentDuration` provided. `unit` can be `MONTH`, `YEAR`, `DAY`.                                                                                                             | Yes, but can be skipped if `consentDateRange` is specified |
| `consentDateRange` has 2 components-`startDate` and `endDate` | These timestamps define the time period for which the consent is valid and can be used to fetch data. Provides the same functionality as `consentDuration`, hence use only one of these. If both `consentDuration` and `consentDateRange` are passed, then `consentDuration` takes precedence.                                                                                                               | Yes, but can be skipped if `consentDuration` is specified  |

| `additionalParams`                                            | Allows you to specify additional parameters for the consent request. Currently, we have `tags` specified under it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | No                                                         |

### Consent response object

| Property Name | Description                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`          | Unique consent reference Id generated by Setu. Use this to poll consent status or initiate data session requests.                                          |
| `url`         | Redirect your users to Setu AA screens to initiate consent review flow using this url                                                                      |
| `status`      | Consent status of the consent request `id`. This will be `PENDING` for a newly created consent.                                                            |
| `Usage`       | This field specifies `lastUsed` and `count` which corresponds to data fetches against the consent id. It is also available in Get Consent Status response. |

### Understanding Tags in AA Framework

• Tags must first be created at the product instance level before they can be used in any requests.

• Tags can be created and managed while setting up or updating a product instance. They are unique identifiers (max 100 characters) that can be linked to multiple product instances.

• Tags are visible in consent and data-fetch reports, and serve as filters in analytics dashboards. Use them to track user journeys, monitor failures, analyze behavior, measure campaign performance, and generate custom insights.

• Key limitations and rules:

- Tags are case-insensitive (e.g., "partnerA" = "PartnerA")
- Duplicate tags are not allowed
- Bulk tagging for historical data is not supported
- Number of tags per FIU is configurable
- Invalid characters will trigger errors
- System issues may prevent tag application (with error notifications)

• Best practice: Use clear, consistent, and easily understandable tag names for effective tracking.

• To add tags to a consent request, include them under the `additionalParams` field:

<CodeBlockWithCopy language="json">
  {`{
  "consentDetail": {
    ...
  },
  ...,
  "additionalParams": {
    "tags": ["Loan_Tracking", "Partner_X"]
  }
}`}
</CodeBlockWithCopy>
