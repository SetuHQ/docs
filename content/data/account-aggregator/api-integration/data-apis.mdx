## Data Flow

Below is a summary of the APIs you need to use to fetch FI data. These APIs are to be used only once your customer has approved consent request. The flow mainly involves data fetching against a valid data session with below APIs.

-   **Create Data Session**—Call this API against an `APPROVED` consent. This initiates data preparation at user's linked FIP accounts. You will be notified by Setu once the data is ready to be fetched.
-   **Fetch FI data**—Fetch decrypted FI data with data session id.

### Create new Data Session API

Call this API to create a data session against the approved `consentId`.

##### Request

Specify the format in which you wish to receive the decrypted financial data, this can be **xml** or **json**.

<Callout type="tip">
    Make sure that values of <code>DataRange</code> array in the body, matches
    or is within the <code>FIDataRange</code> specified in the Create consent
    request API.
</Callout>

<br />

<CodeBlockWithCopy language="json">
    {`POST /sessions
{
    "consentId": "d4f40bd9-a22f-4408-a622-4e8a1e4fbda6",
    "DataRange": {
        "from": "2016-12-06T11:39:57.153Z",
        "to": "2021-12-31T14:25:33.440Z"
    },
    "format": "json"
}`}
</CodeBlockWithCopy>

##### Response

This initiates a data session with a `id`, that uniquely identifies this data request. Setu will also notify you when the FIP is ready to share the data you requested and you can use the `id` to fetch the data with the next API.

<CodeBlockWithCopy language="json">
    {`{
    "status": "PENDING",
    "format": "json",
    "Payload": null,
    "id": "378ec65c-f558-49fc-89ea-e880c2cf88b3",

    },
    "consentId": "d4f40bd9-a22f-4408-a622-4e8a1e4fbda6"
}`}
</CodeBlockWithCopy>

<br />

<Callout type="warning">
    If the request gives you a <code>502 BAD GATEWAY</code> error, please retry
    the request. This is a known issue and will be solved
</Callout>

### Fetch FI data

The notification URL you have configured with Setu will be used to notify you when data is ready to be fetched. Then,

Use the `id` received in Create Data Session API in the previous step to call this API to fetch the financial information of your user.

##### Request

If you request for multiple FI types, you will receive all the FI data from end-user's linked accounts in an array.

<CodeBlockWithCopy language="json">{`GET /sessions/:id`}</CodeBlockWithCopy>

##### Response

The response comes with status:

-   `COMPLETED` which signifies that FI data fetch is completed for the requested session.
-   `PARTIAL` which signifies that some FIP FI data fetches are completed and some have failed for the requested session.
-   `PENDING` which signifies that some FIP FI data fetches are completed and some are still pending for the requested session.

The payload contains Profile, Summary and Transactions as requested in Create consent request.
