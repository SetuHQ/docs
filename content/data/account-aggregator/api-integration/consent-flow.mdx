## Consent flow

Get users' consent before you can start pulling their financial data with Setu AA by initiating Consent flow in your application. This flow broadly consists of two parts:

1.  **Create Consent Request**—this is essentially a one-time data request that your user needs to approve. The consent request contains a [`Detail`](%28/data/account-aggregator/consent-object%29) object which specifies details around—
    - the data you’ve requested for
    - the purpose of requesting the data
    - the frequency of data fetch

- Once a consent is created, you will receive a unique `id` with status = `PENDING`, along with a `url` where you can **redirect your customer to consent manager screens**, to review the data request. Here, the user may approve or reject the request. Read more about Consent Manager [here.](https://staging.docs.setu.co/data/account-aggregator/consent-manager)

2. **Consent Request status**—You can track the consent status with Get Consent Status API, alternatively Setu will notify you when the user has acted upon the consent request. See [Notifications](/data/account-aggregator/api-integration/notifications) to configure your notification endpoint.

### Create Consent API

Call this API to create a consent request. The details of the request will be presented to your customer on Setu’s screens, as part of the next step.

###### Response

Consent gets created with a unique identifier `id` with status as `PENDING`. Redirect your customers to consent manager `url` to initiate consent review flow.

<CodeBlockWithCopy language="json">
  {`{
    "id": "60c76fa3-601c-4b9d-ad30-d33c0ebcacf3",
    "url": "https://fiu-uat.setu.co/consents/webview/60c76fa3-601c-4b9d-ad30-d33c0ebcacf3",
    "status": "PENDING",
    "Detail": {
      //consent details object
}
}`}
</CodeBlockWithCopy>

<hr class="primary" />

### Consent Review by customer

On redirecting your users to `url`, it opens up a Consent Manager that permits consent approval/rejection. This url can easily be embedded as a webview or be used to redirect from a website. The URL is of the form:

`https://<fiu-base-url>/consents/webview/<id>`

- `<fiu-base-url>` — This is the base URL provided by Setu.
- `<id>` — This is the request ID of the consent generated returned after the create consent request.

On getting redirected to the url, your users will be asked to verify their mobile number to further initiate the account fetching process. The mobile verification does a login, or register them with Setu using their mobile number. Setu creates a unique account aggregator handle for every registered customer.

The following steps are handled by Setu’s screens—

- OTP verification on user's mobile number
- Setu authenticates the user and displays the data request
- Setu fetches the Financial Information Providers or FIPs
- User links the FIPs and reviews the request
- Setu validates and saves consent
- Setu sends notification to you to confirm consent approval. At this point, consent `status` is APPROVED or REJECTED

<Callout type="tip">
  Use Setu FIP and get access to mock financial data on staging{" "}
</Callout>

<br />

**Test this flow as FIU developer**

Only for testing this flow, replace the placeholders in the consent manager URL—`https://<fiu-base-url>/consents/webview/<id>?redirect_url={yourRedirectURL}`. Visit the URL to approve consent.

<Callout type="tip">
  This URL is optional when testing as an FIU developer.
</Callout>

<br />

### Get Consent Status API

Call this API to get the updated status of a consent request by passing its unique `id`.

If the consent is approved, the Status in the response will be `ACTIVE`. After this, you can now initiate Data flow for the approved consent request.

<Callout type="highlight">
  <strong>Additionally</strong>, Setu AA will notify you on the consent status
  update by sending a webhook notification to the configured endpoint you
  entered on the Bridge. See more details on{" "}
