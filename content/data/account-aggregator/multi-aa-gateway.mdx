## Setu multi-AA gateway

Setu’s multi-AA gateway is a powerful enhancement for Account Aggregator (AA) connectivity to smartly route consent requests by dynamically selecting the most performant AA based on various criteria. 

This improves consent conversion, offers redundancy with multiple AA partners, and ensures higher performance across AA integrations.

### How to set up Multi-AA connectivity with Setu's AA Gateway
To leverage the Multi-AA Gateway, you as a Financial Information User (FIU) must follow these steps—
<br/>

#### Step 1—Opt in for Multi-AA connectivity
You must inform our on-boarding or support teams that you want to enable multi-AA connectivity. You can request for this at support@setu.co.

  <strong>Note</strong> —This will be enabled on your dashboard in an automated fashion soon.

<br/>

#### Step 2—Sign multi-AA agreements
You must have agreements in place with Setu (who is your TSP), as well as each of the supported Account Aggregators (AAs), they you want to use in the multi-AA system. 

Currently, Setu supports the following AAs:
- <a href="https://setu-aa.com/" target="_blank">Setu AA</a>
- <a href="https://www.onemoney.in/" target="_blank">OneMoney</a>
- <a href="https://www.anumati.co.in/" target="_blank">Anumati</a>
- <a href="https://finvu.in/" target="_blank">Finvu</a>
- <a href="https://saafe.in/" target="_blank">Saafe</a>

<Callout type="highlight">
  You can of course also choose to use a single AA for your integration, that can help with on-boarding you faster as an FIU. For this, you can proceed to the <a href="/data/account-aggregator/quickstart">Quickstart</a>.

  If you want more information on multi-AA to make this decision, we also suggest going through the <a href="/data/account-aggregator/multi-aa-gateway#benefits-of-multi-AA">Benefits of multi AA</a> section below.

#### Step 3—Use the Create Consent API
Setu has created a seamless multi-AA connectivity suite. You as an FIU must integrate and use the same APIs, and can create consents across any of the chosen AA partners via the <a href="/data/account-aggregator/api-integration/consent-flow#create-consent-api" target="_blank">Create Consent API</a>. 

This API allows you to create consent requests without needing to pre-select a specific AA. The API will dynamically route the request to the most optimal AA based on factors such as performance and account availability.

If the FIU wishes to select a specific AA, they simply need to add a handle suffix to the Create Consent API request in the `vua` field.

### Benefits of multi-AA

The multi-AA gateway offers several benefits to FIUs and Account Aggregators.

###### 1. Improved consent conversion
By routing consent requests to the most performant AA, the multi-AA gateway increases the likelihood of successful consent completion, reduced failure rates and improved overall conversion rates.

###### 2. Redundancy and resilience
Having multiple AAs integrated into the routing engine ensures that there is always a backup, in case one AA faces performance issues or is temporarily unavailable.

###### 3. Higher performance
AAs are continuously monitored for success rates and latency. The system selects the AA with the best performance metrics, ensuring a higher quality of service for end users.

###### 4. Simple integration
Setu APIs are standardised across all AAs, ensuring seamless integration and making it easier for FIUs to manage consent workflows without worrying about AA-specific API integrations.

All data from AAs are also always shared in the standardised format specified by ReBIT.  

###### 5. Customisation and flexibility
In the future, FIUs will be able to prioritise certain AAs based on business needs, allowing more granular control over the consent routing process.
