## API integration

Setu Insights’s APIs can be broken down into 3 broad flows—

-   **AA integration flow**—This section deals with validating the users data that was received from FIP (against the data format set by REBIT) and assigning a data ID to this FIData Block.
-   **Reports flow**—This section deals with pulling a list of all available insights that the Setu BSA can provide, and configuring the exact set of insights that the FIU requires. Post configuring a report, a report ID is generated.
-   **Insights flow**—This is the section where the actual analysis is done. Taking data from data id, and using the template of the report ID, a job ID is created. This job ID contains the details of the analysis, and is sent to the URL that you choose at the start of the integration process.

What is an FIData Block?

-   FIData blocks is the data received from the FIP (Financial Information Provider), via the AA. Currently, we only support bank statement data.

What is a Report?

-   A report is the template in which the FIU wants the insights to be generated. An FIU can pick and choose exactly what modules should be added to a report based on their needs. For example, if an FIU only wants to get the income and expenses of a customer, the report can contain only those two modules.

Before starting integration, familiarise yourself with <a href="/data/account-aggregator/consent-object" target="_blank">**Consent Object**</a> which would act as a binding contract for all your data pulls.
