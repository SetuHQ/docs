## Quickstart Guide

Here is a quick summary of steps to help you integrate with Setu’s Insights API. Before you start, there are some key terms that will be referred to periodically in the documentation—

-   **FI Datablock**— FI Datablocks is the data received from the FIP (Financial Information Provider), via the AA. Currently, we only support bank statement data.
-   **Report**— A report is the template in which the FIU wants the insights to be generated. An FIU can pick and choose exactly what modules should be added to a report based on their needs. For example, if an FIU only wants to get the income and expenses of a customer, the report can contain only those two modules.

### Step 1 - Report creation

FIU needs to provide Setu with the following items for configuration

-   **FIU ID** received from the integration with AA
-   **Name** for the report, and a list of required <a href="/data/bank-statement-analyser/postman" target="_blank">**Insights**</a>
-   **Format** of the report's output (currently defaults to `JSON`)

Please send these details via email to [bsa@setu.co](mailto:bsa@setu.co)

Setu will create a report for the FIU and share a `Report ID`, which can be used when [generating insights](#step-3-generate-insights)

### Step 2 - AA Gateway integration

#### Create FI-Datablocks

Create an FI Datablock in Setu's Insights module by making a POST call to `/v1/fi_data` with the data fetched from the FIP

-   The payload should be the same data fetched from the FIP. The schema of this data is validated against the [ReBIT schema](https://api.rebit.org.in/schema)
-   The API returns a `Data ID` for the datablock along with some metadata, which can be used when [generating insights](#step-3-generate-insights)
-   A list of available data blocks can also be obtained by making a GET call to `/v1/fi_data`

<Callout type="tip">
    FI Datablocks will be auto-fetched from the FIP in future.
</Callout>

### Step 3 - Generate Insights

-   Generate Insights by making an API call to `/v1/insight`, with the report ID, and a list of data IDs in the payload
-   The API will post an asynchronous job and return a Job ID, which can later be used to obtain the insights generated
-   Setu will post a <a href="/data/account-aggregator/api-integration/notifications" target="_blank">notification</a> to the **notification endpoint** <a href="/data/account-aggregator/quickstart#integrating-fiu-apis-on-sandbox" target="_blank">configured for the FIU app</a>, along with the generated insights

## Test on Postman or integrate APIs

If you are getting started with the integration, we recommend that you familiarise yourself with setting up Postman and configuring **credentials**. If you have already completed this step, you can integrate with the Setu Insights APIs directly.
